(building and scaling high performance technology organizations)
#forsgren-humble-kim

\[The\] evidence refutes that the bimodal IT notion that you have to choose between speed and stability - instead, speed depends on stability, so good IT practices give you both.

By helping the industry identify and understand the capabilities that actually drive performance improvements in a statistically meaningful way - more than just anecdote, and beyond the experiences of one of a few teams - we can help the industry improve.

Software delivery is an exercise in continuous improvement, and our research shows that year over year the best keep getting better, and those who fail to improve fall further and further behind.

\[Organizations need to use\] small teams that work in short cycles and measure feedback from users to build products and services that delight their customers and rapidly deliver value \[back\] to their organisations

Software and technology are key differentiators for organizations to deliver value to customers and stakeholders.

Technology leaders need to deliver software quickly and reliably to win the market. \[...\] Whether you’re trying to generate profits or not, any organization today depends on technology to achieve its mission and provide value to its customers or stakeholders quickly, reliably, and securely. Whatever the mission, how a technology organization performs can predict overall organizational performance.

Capability models focus on helping an organization continually improve and progress, realizing that the technological and business landscape is ever-changing.

It’s worth noting that the ability to take an experimental approach to product development is highly correlated with the technical practices that contribute to continuous delivery.

Before you are ready to deploy a scientific approach to improving performance, you must first understand and develop your culture. 
 #anthropology #culture

Google found that “who is on a team matters less than how the team members interact, structure their work, and view their own contributions”. In other words, it all comes down to team dynamics.

Computers perform repetitive tasks; people solve problems.

If you want to improve your culture, implementing CD practices will help. \[...\] Even better, our research found that improvements in CD brought payoffs in the way that work FELT.

Architecture and teams \[need\] to be loosely coupled. \[...\] Of course DevOps is all about better collaboration between teams, and we don’t mean to suggest that teams shouldn’t work together. The goal of a loosely coupled architecture is to ensure that the available communication bandwidth isn’t overwhelmed by fine-grained decision-making at the implementation level, so we can instead use that bandwidth for discussing higher-level shared goals and how to achieve them.

Burnout is a physical, mental or emotional exhaustion caused by overwork or stress - but it is more than just being overworked or stressed. Burnout can make the things we once loved about our work and life seem insignificant and dull. It often manifests itself as a feeling of helplessness, and is correlated with pathological cultures and unproductive, wasteful work.

Burnout can be prevented or reversed, and DevOps can help. Organizations can fix the conditions that lead to burnout by fostering a supportive work environment, by ensuring work is meaningful, and ensuring employees understand how their own work ties to strategic objectives.

A point worth mentioning is the importance of values alignment and its role in fighting burnout. When organizational values and individual values aren’t aligned, you are more likely to see burnout in employees, particularly in demanding and high-risk work like technology.

People are at the heart of every technology transformation. \[...\] Every good manager knows this.

Looking at the measures that correlate strongly with job satisfaction, we see some commonalities. Practices like proactive monitoring and test and deployment automation all automate menial tasks and require people to make decisions based on a feedback loop. Instead of managing tasks, people get to make decisions, employing their skills, experience, and judgement.

Building trust is the most important thing you can do, and it must be built over time. Trust is built on kept promises, open communication, and behaving predictably even in stressful situations.

Research has shown that organizational culture is predictive of technology and organizational performance, is predictive of performance outcomes, and that team dynamics and psychological safety are the most important aspects in understanding team performance.
