#machiavelli
**Foreword: In particular Machiavelli is fascinated by the way certain personality traits can mesh positively or negatively with certain sets of historical circumstances. A man can be successful in one situation then fail miserably in another; a policy that works well in one moment is a disaster in the next. Rather than one ideal ruler, then, different men are required for different situations. \[...\] reading The Prince is it impossible not to engage with the disturbing notion that politics cannot be governed by the ethical codes that most of us seek to observe in our ordinary lives.

  

Upheaval, on the contrary, always leaves the scaffolding for building further change. 

  

If you go and live in the territory you’ve taken, you’re very unlikely to lose it. 

  

Remember what doctors tell us about tuberculosis: in its early stages its easy to cure and hard to diagnose, but if you don’t spot it and treat it, as time goes by it gets easy to diagnose and hard to cure. So it is with affairs of state. See trouble in advance (but you have to be shrewd) and you can clear it up quickly. Miss it, and by the time it’s big enough for everyone to see it will be too late to do anything about it. 

  

In this regard it’s worth noting that you must either pamper people or destroy them; harm them just a little and they’ll hit back; harm them seriously and they won’t be able to. 

  

The fact is that although people almost always proceed by imitation, following in another man’s footsteps, you can never tread a model’s path or reproduce his qualities exactly. So, if you’re sensible, you set out to follow a trail blazed by someone who was truly great, someone really worth imitating, so that even if you’re not on the same level yourself at least you’ll reflect a little of his brilliance. 

  

Like anything that appears suddenly and grows fast, regimes that come out of nothing inevitably have shallow roots and will tend to crash in the first storm. 

  

On the other hand, we can hardly describe killing fellow citizens, betraying friends and living without loyalty, mercy or creed as signs of talent. Methods like that may bring you power, but not glory. 

  

When people are treated well by someone they thought was hostile they respond with even greater loyalty. \[...\] When he’s a man of spirit who knows how to lead and doesn’t panic when things get tough, a man who takes the right precautions whose personality and style of government keeps everybody in a positive state of mind, then the people will never let him down and time will show what solid foundations he laid. 

  

If you want to play the good man in a world where most people are not good, you’ll end up badly. Hence, if a ruler wants to survive, he’ll have to learn to stop being good, or at least when the occasion demands. 

  

When we talk about anyone, but especially about leaders, who are more exposed than others to the public eye, what we point out are the qualities that prompt praise or blame. \[...\] Since a ruler can’t be generous and show it without putting himself at risk, if he’s sensible he won’t mind getting a reputation for meanness. With time, when people see that his penny-pinching means he doesn’t need to raise taxed and can defend the country against attack and embark on campaigns without putting a burden on his people, he’ll increasingly be seen as generous - generous to those he takes nothing from, which is to say almost everybody, and mean to those who get nothing from him, which is to say very few. 

  

A ruler and a man seeking power are two different things. For the ruler in power generosity is dangers; for the man seeking power it is essential. 

  

Nothing wins a ruler like great military victories and a display of remarkable personal qualities. 

  

It is in the nature of things that every time you try to avoid one danger you run into another. Good sense consists in being able to assess the dangers and choose the lesser of various evils.

One change always leaves a toothing-stone for the next.
