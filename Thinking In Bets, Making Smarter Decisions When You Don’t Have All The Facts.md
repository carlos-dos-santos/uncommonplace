**Mistakes, emotions, losing - those things are all inevitable because we are human. The approach of thinking in bets moved me toward objectivity, accuracy, and open-mindedness. That movement compounds over time to create significant changes in our lives. 

  

Life is poker, not chess. Chess, for all its strategic complexity, isn’t a great model for decision-making in life, where most of our decisions involve hidden information and a much greater influence of luck. This creates a challenge that doesn’t exist in chess: identifying the relative contributions of the decisions we make versus luck in how things turn out. Poker, in contrast, is a game of incomplete information. 

  

An expert in any field will have an advantage over a rookie. But neither the veteran nor the rookie can be sure what the next flip will look like. The veteran will just have a better guess. 

  

For most of our decisions, there will be a lot of space between unequivocal “right” and “wrong”. When we move away from a world where there are only two opposing and discrete boxes that decisions can be put in - right or wrong - we start living in the continuum between the extremes. Making better decisions stops being about wrong or right but about calibrating among all the shades of grey. 

  

Don’t fall in love or even date anybody if you only want positive results. The world is structured to give us lots of opportunities to feel bad about being wrong if we want to measure ourselves by outcomes. Don’t fall for it! 

  

This is ultimately very good news: part of the skill in life comes from learning to be a better belief calibrator, using experience and information to more objectively update our beliefs to more accurately represent the world. The more accurate our beliefs, the better the foundation of the bets we make. 

  

Abstract belief formation (that is, beliefs outside our direct experience, conveyed through language) is likely among the few things that are uniquely human, making it relatively new in the scope of evolutionary time. 

  

Whether it is a football game, a protest, or just about anything else, our pre-existing beliefs influence the way we experience the world. That those beliefs aren’t formed in a particularly orderly way leads to all sorts of mischief in our decision-making. 

  

Haidt: “If you put individuals together in the right way, such that some individuals can use their reasoning powers to disconfirm the claims of others, and all individuals feel some common bond or shared fate that allows them to interact civilly, you can create a group that ends up producing good reasoning as an emergent property of the social system. This is why it’s so important to have intellectual and ideological diversity within any group or institution whose goal is to find truth.”

  

Outcomes are rarely the result of our decision quality alone or chance alone, and outcome quality is not a perfect indicator of the influence of luck or skill. 

  

It is almost impossible for us, on our own, to get the diversity of viewpoints provided by the combined manpower of a well-formed decision pod. To get a more objective view of the world, we need an environment that exposes us to alternate hypotheses and different perspectives. That doesn’t apply only to the world around us: to view ourselves in a more realistic way, we need other people to fill in our blind spots. We already know why we’re right. What we need help with is why we are wrong. 

  

We treat outcomes as good signals for decision quality, as if we were playing chess. If the outcome is known, it will bias the assessment of the decision quality to align with the outcome quality. 

  

This idea that seeing our aged future-self could help us make better allocation decisions is based, in part, on research by Jeremy Bailenson and Laura Carstensen of Stanford University’s Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies. They used immersive virtual reality technology in a lab setting to demonstrate \[seeing an age-progressed version of themselves meant participants allocated more than double the amount ($178.10 vs $73.90) to their retirement fund\]. This is a startling example of how future-us can act as an effective decision  buddy for present-us. 

  

The word “wrong” deserves its own swear jar. The Mertonian norm of organised skepticism allows little place in exploratory discussion for the word “wrong”. “Wrong” is a conclusion, not a rationale. And it’s not a particularly accurate rationale since, as we know, nearly nothing is 100% or 0%. Any words or thoughts denying the existence of uncertainty should be a signal that we’re heading toward a poorly-calibrated decision. 

  

Oettingen recognised that we need to have positive goals, but we are more likely to execute on those goals if we think about the negative futures.

  

Life, like poker, is one long game, and there are going to be a lot of losses, even after making the best possible bets. We are going to do better, and be happier, if we start by recognising that we’ll never be sure of the future. That changes our tasks from trying to be right every time, an impossible job, to navigating our way through the uncertainty by calibrating our beliefs to move toward, little by little, a more accurate and objective representation of the world. With strategic foresight and perspective, that’s manageable work. If we keep learning and calibrating, we might even get good at it.
