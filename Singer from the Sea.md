She leaned upon the rail, sick to her heart, the pain spreading outward, through all her body and mind. She remained still, in turmoil, her mind chattering like birds in a tree, saying six things at once, none of them helpful

Oh, yes, my dear. The story is real. When you must lie, my dear, lie as little as possible. That way you'll have the least to remember

Aufors smiled.  
What? Demanded the Marshall  
I've heard it claimed that woman themselves should do the choosing of their mates since anything else is tantamount to slavery and rape.

Genevieve shifted on the hard seat, making herself more comfortable. "Stephanie said each living world has a soul that includes all the creatures in it. And if we kill all the other creatures, you know, like the did on Old Earth, then the spirit departs."  
"It dies?"  
"No, it goes away. Somewhere else. And once that happens, the world has no soul. Do you think that could be true?"  
He nodded to himself, thinking. "Well, if everything in a world is tied together, if each thing is a part of something else and you can't take it away without changing the other thing, then IF there are souls, it stands to reason the souls would apply to the whole rather than to the part. Wouldn't it?"  
She nodded, slowly. "That's what I thought. Partly because of the way I feel sometimes, looking at a sunset or during a storm of rain when the trees move and sigh, and I get this feeling, this kind of "wholeness" feeling, as though I was feeling the whole world moving in me. I don't get that feeling in cities, or just from other people. So, it could be, you know, that the world has a soul and we're part of that, and when we're right with it, we can feel part of it, too..."  
"Besides," said Jeorfy, "all of us humans are pretty much alike, aren't we, so if we all had souls, our souls would be very much alike. You read old, old books, and the people in them are just like the people now. Same emotions, same hopes and fears. Same sins. Same virtues. But worlds... Now worlds are unique and they're always changing"

Men of customary inaction \[can\] be spurred to sporadic express. Such men often start ill-planned projects that they lack either energy to complete or the wit to abandon

She had not known she was in love with him until the moment of leaving him. She had wanted to be with him, surely, because he flattered her and she felt wonderful in his company, but she had not known this feeling until he held her.

She sighed, giving up thought. Thought did no good at all

Aufors himself remembered a certain delicacy and grace and how flowery she smelled and how he had loved her laughing manner and diligent care and, above all, how clever she had been at figuring things out and solving problems. \[...\] he wasn't thinking about matches at all, but about Genevieve, her comfort, her health, her pleasure \[and\] her safety.

Burning with desire to be helpful to Genevieve, he did it all eagerly and without a second thought.

If you think being married isn't hard, no matter to who, you're still a child. Marriage is about the hardest thing in the world, girl. If people knew all about marriage in advance, likely they never would. They do it when they're green in hope, like you, with the sap of passion flowing. So do it while you've still got the incentive!

If my life is a part of the world-soul, it is truly immortal

In an impotent fury he admitted to himself that there might well be things going on he did not understand

I never understood why they called it chemistry. But now I see that once you have those reactions it can't be undone.
