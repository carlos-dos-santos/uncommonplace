The biggest flaw of the old waterfall process has always been, and remains, that all the risk is at the end, which means that customer validation happens way too late.

Products \[should be\] defined and designed collaboratively, rather than sequentially.

It’s all about solving problems, not implementing features. Conventional product roadmaps are all about output. Strong teams know it’s not only about implementing a solution. They must ensure that solution solves the underlying problem. It’s about business results. 
#problemsolving 

The point is to have a very inclusive and holistic definition of product. You are not just concerned with implementing features. 

Without this deep customer knowledge, you’re just guessing. This requires both qualitative learning (to understand why our users and customers behave the way they do), and quantitative learning (to understand what they are doing).

The morale of the engineers is very much a function of you as the product manager. It is your job to make sure they feel like missionaries and not mercenaries. You do this by involving them deeply in the customer pain you are trying to solve the business problems you face.

Developing great people requires a different set of skills than developing great products, which is why many otherwise excellent product managers and designers never progress to leading organizations.

Good product organizations have a strong team, a solid vision, and consistent execution. A great product organization adds the dimension of a strong product culture. 
#culture

I often have to explain to companies that there is never a perfect way to structure a team - every attempt at structuring the product organization will be optimized for some things at the expense of others. 
#compromise 

It is management’s responsibility to provide each product team with the specific business objectives they need to tackle. The difference is that they are now prioritizing business results, rather than product ideas. \[...\] It is all about outcome rather than output. \[You know that\] product teams are stepping up to solve business problems rather than build features. 
#meaningfulness 

Critical risks: Will the customer buy this, or choose to use it (value risk)? Can the user figure out how to use it (usability risk)? Can we build it (feasibility risk)? Does this solution work for our business (business viability risk)?

There are few things as powerful as a marketing person who’s also strong at product. The combination is amazing. 
#marketing 

I have been a long time fan of public APIs as a part of a company’s product strategy. I consider developers to be one of the consistently best sources of truly innovative product ideas. Developers are in the best position to see what’s just now possible, and so many innovations are powered by these insights.

The overarching purpose of any form of prototype is to learn something at a much lower cost in terms of time and effort than building out a product. All forms of prototype should require at least an order of magnitude less time and effort as the eventual product.
