Wild geese scream shrilly on muffled winds.
The morning snow is heavy, weather cloudy and cold.
Poor, I can give you nothing in parting
but the blue mountains and they'll always be with you.

One's opportunities for feeling ill at ease in life are countless and I recognise them, they constantly return, each affliction in its own little compartment. I should be familiar with this state of affairs and by now I should have found the right answer to the problem but I haven't. There is no practical answer, is there? So we just listen.
