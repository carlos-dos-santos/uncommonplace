In art school they talked about day jobs in tones of horror. She would never have imagined that her day job would be the calmest and least cluttered part of her life. 

  

She knows there are traps everywhere that can make her cry, she knows the way she dies a little every time someone asks her for change and she doesn’t give it to them means that she’s too soft for this world or perhaps just for this city, she feels so small here. There are tears in her eyes now. Miranda is a person with very few certainties, but one of them is that only the dishonourable leave when things get difficult. 

  

“A fragment for my friend - 

If your soul left this earth I would follow and find you

Silent, my starship suspended in night”

  

The corporate world’s full of ghosts \[...\] high functioning sleepwalkers.

  

On silent afternoons in his brother’s apartment, Jeevan found himself thinking about how human the city is, how human everything is. We bemoaned the impersonality of the modern world, but all that was a lie, it seemed to him; it had never been impersonal at all. There had always been a massive delicate infrastructure of people, all of them working unnoticed around us, and when people stop going to work, the entire operation grinds to a halt. No one delivers fuel to the gas stations or the airports. Cars are stranded. Airplanes cannot fly. Trucks remain at their points of origin. Food never reaches the cities; grocery stores close. Businesses are locked down and then looted. No one comes to work at the power plants or the substations, no one removes fallen trees from electrical lines. 

  

He had an idea - too sentimental to speak aloud and he knew none of his divorced friends would ever own up to it - that something must linger, a half-life of marriage, some sense memory of love even if obviously not the thing itself. He thought these people must mean something to one another, even if they didn’t like one another any more. 

  

She was thinking about the way she’d always taken for granted that the world had certain people in it, either central to her days or unseen and infrequently thought of. How without any one of these people the world is a subtly but unmistakably altered place, the dial turned just one or two degrees.
