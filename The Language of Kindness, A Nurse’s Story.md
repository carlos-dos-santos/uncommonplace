Mark Twain - Kindness is the language which the deaf can hear and the blind can see.

You cannot separate mind and body. We are all souls, housed in flesh. 

Nurses do not explicitly search for meaning, but it is part and parcel of their day job. Nurses certainly use the language of the heart. They understand and describe patients as broken-hearted. Many nurses has seen it. And the best nursing comes from the heart, and not from the head. 

But for all that I’ve seen and touched and smelled, and as difficult as it is at the time, there is a patient at the centre of it, afraid and embarrassed. Nurses make good poker players, understanding the importance of not breathing in; of breath-holding so subtly that the patient does not realise, and does not see any expression other than a matter-of-fact one. The horror of our bodies - our humanity, our flesh and blood - is something nurses must bear, lest the patient think too deeply, remember the lack of dignity that makes us all vulnerable. It is our vulnerability that unites us. Promoting dignity in the face of illness is one of the best gifts a nurse can give. 

Simone de Beauvoir - Life is occupied in both perpetuating itself and in surpassing itself; if all it does is maintain itself, then living is only not dying. 

  

Mother Teresa - Not all of us can do great things. But we can do small things with great love.

  

We are getting used to seeing the patient first, holistically, before simply correcting the numbers. 

  

Tracy shakes her head. “If the Hippocratic Oath is to “Do no harm”, then a nurses’ oath should be to make sure the doctor can fulfil their Hippocratic Oath.” She laughs. “I think all junior doctors should have to spend a month as a nurse. We’d never have to clean a coffee cup left in the sink again, that’s for sure.”

  

If a couple have been married for a lifetime, it often happens that when one dies, the other die soon afterwards. We can’t write “Broken-hearted” on the cause-of-death forms, of course, but that’s what I believe it to be. Broken-hearted people stop taking care of themselves. They don’t eat, wash, sleep. They are between worlds, cold with grief. 

  

What is the cost of all this \[emotional labour\] to the nurses, I wonder, and how little is it valued? 

  

Cancer Research UK describes chemotherapy as taking a sledgehammer to a hazelnut.

  

I can only remind myself, as I get older and see more and more cancer around me, to live well and happily, to value that which makes us who we are; not material possessions, but love, kindness, and hope. I try to remember every day that we do not control the wind. 

  

I have been a nurse for twenty years. But it is only when my dad is dying, too quickly, from lung cancer, that I begin to understand the importance of kindness and the depths of humanity and philosophy underneath. When all else has failed - the chemotherapy, radiotherapy and the drugs - and hope has left the room along with the team of oncologists, radiologists, technicians and scientists, it’s the nurse at his bedside who offers something else: dignity, peace, even love. 

I learn then that nursing is not so much about tasks, but about how in every detail a nurse can provide comfort to a patient and a family. It is a privilege to witness people at the frailest, most significant and most extreme moments of life, and to have the capacity to love complete strangers. Nursing, like poetry, is the place where metaphorical and literal meanings cross borders.  
  

Dying is not always the worst thing. Living a long life and suffering cruelty in old age is the terrible fate that waits for many of us. We will all get sick and die, or we will get old. We can only hope that those caring for us are kind, and that they are empathetic and altruistic. 

  

There are always people other than the family who are devastated by the death of a patient in hospital: the doctors, the nurses, the lady who brought tea and biscuits and chatted to the patient every day, the healthcare assistant who helped the patient read the menu, the hairdresser who came to the ward, the pharmacy assistant who checked the drugs chart and stopped to chat a while. 

  

“What the doctor is saying is that we can’t do any more for Sarah. But what he means is that we can’t save your child’s body. He has tried his very best. We all have. There is more we can do, still. For Sarah and for you. I am here, and I will be with you, and we will make memories over these next few days. We will make sure that Sarah is not in pain any more, and is comforted and peaceful; and you will get to hold her and be there for her before she dies and afterwards. And I will be right there with you. I am with you.”
