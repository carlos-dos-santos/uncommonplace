**There is nothing more unsociable than Man, and nothing more sociable: unsociable by his vice, sociable by his nature.

  

There is hardly less torment in running a family than in running a whole country. 

  

There you see what it means to choose treasures which no harm can corrupt and to hide them in a place which no one can enter, no one betray, save we ourselves. 

  

Glory and tranquility cannot dwell in the same lodgings.

  

I get others to say what I cannot put so well myself, sometimes because of the weakness of my language and sometimes because of the weakness of my intellect.

  

Indeed, recognizing our ignorance is one of the surest and most beautiful witnesses to our judgement that I can find. 

  

No passion disturbs the soundness of our judgement as anger does.**
