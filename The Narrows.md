Sim sat there for what felt like an hour, thinking calmlyÂ  about how easy it would be to just slide forward.That was all she would have to do; give herself a little push, and then her body would somersault into the river, just like those stridges had two months before when she and Pru had thrown them off the bridge. For a few beautiful moments it would be like she was flying, weightless, until the water hit her and it would all be over: her endless, crazy infatuation with Wood, the incessant worry that people would hate her for who she was, the dread sitting at the bottom of her stomach, promising that she would forever be alone. No one would love her, not ever.  
And then it was time to go. Sim hoisted herself to her feet and hopped back onto the bike path. There was more to the world than what she knew. Only that thought, that one comforting thought - that she could maybe search and find some answers - gave her hope. For a moment her bike was solid beneath her, and then she was flying down the ramp and back toward the Mondran Quarter, back to Kailash.
