To have a body is to learn to grieve - Michael Heffernan

Yes, the appendix is a relic and a liability, but only to the same degree as every other inch of the shambling, flaking, leaking, throbbing concatenation of relics and liabilities that I proudly call my mortal body - Ned Beauman

Our seeing creates a boundary. But seeing is not simply the practicality of looking and of navigating. Of our five senses, vision dominates and it is intimately bound up with our consciousness. 

When we make 'eye contact', the organ viewed from the outside is a gorgeous thing, the irises blue, green brown, hazel, grey - those threads of colour like a gathering storm or tilled earth, all converging on the black of the pupil. 

There are, I realised, other forms of seeing and knowing. Hull's depiction is of a paradigm shift where the intimacy of blindness alters one's consciousness. 

As John Hull says, 'Sighted people live in a world that is a projection of their sighted bodies. It is not THE world, it is a world.' #sight #the-senses 

Most of us take our sightedness for granted, and our sense of who we are comes almost casually, slyly, bound up with that. Blindness, especially when it befalls one later than early childhood, can feel at first like a bereavement and a strange, intimate trap: an oubliette down which one is forced to fall. For those to whom this has happened, their very consciousness must be remade.

The contemplation of the womb, like staring into the starlit heavens, fills me with imaginings of Somethingness or Nothingness. It was ever thus. \[...\] That space we are born out of, into the world, where the soft iambics of our mother's heart become the first sure verses of our being.

Ingersoll: 

"I know how vain it is to gild a grief with words, and yet I wish to take from every grave its fear. From the wondrous tree of love the buds and blossoms fall with ripened fruit, and in the common bed of earth, patriarchs and babes sleep side by side.

Every cradle asks us "Whence?" and every coffin "Whither?"

They who stand with breaking hearts around this little grave, need have no fear. The larger and the nobler faith in all that is, and is to be, tells us that death, even at its worst, is only perfect rest. 

We have no fear. We are all children of the same mother, and the same fate awaits us all. We, too, have our religion, and it is this: Help for the living - Hope for the dead."
