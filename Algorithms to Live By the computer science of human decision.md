Thinking algorithmically about the world, learning about the fundamental structures of the problems we face and about the properties of their solutions, can help us see how good we actually are, and better understand the errors that we make.

When balancing favourite experiences and new ones, nothing matters as much as the interval over which we plan to enjoy them. \[...\] So explore when you will have the time to use the resulting knowledge, exploit when you’re ready to cash in.

The Gittins index, then, provides a formal, rigorous justification for preferring the unknown, provided we have some opportunity to exploit the results of what we learn from exploring.

To live in a restless world requires a certain restlessness in oneself. So as long as things continue to change, you must never fully cease exploring.

The traditional explanation for the elderly having smaller social networks is that it’s just one example of the decrease in quality of life that comes with ageing - the result of a diminished ability to contribute to social relationships, greater fragility, and general disengagement from society. But \[Laura\] Carstensen has argued that, in fact, the elderly have fewer social relationships by choice. As she puts it, these decreases are “the result of a life-long selection process by which people strategically and adaptively cultivate their social networks to maximise social and emotional gains and minimise social and emotional risks.”

\[In one study\] Carstensen and her colleagues found \[...\] if older people were asked to imagine that a medical breakthrough would allow them to live twenty years longer, their preferences became indistinguishable from those of young people. The point is that these differences in social preference are not about age as such - they’re about where people perceive themselves to be on the interval relevant to their decision.

\[sorting vs searching\]: err on the side of messiness. Sorting something you will never search is a complete waste; searching something you never sorted is merely inefficient. The question, of course, becomes how to estimate ahead of time what your future usage will be.

Ramscar’s group demonstrated the impact of extra information on human memory by focusing on the case of language. Through a series of simulations, the researchers showed that simply knowing more makes things harder when it comes to recognising words, names, and even letters. No matter how good your organization scheme is, having to search through more things will inevitably take longer. It’s not that we’re forgetting; it’s that we’re remembering. We’re becoming archives.

So as you age, and begin to experience these sporadic latencies, take heart: the length of the delay is partly an indicator of the extent of your experience. The effort of retrieval is a testament to how much you know.

Computer scientists now use the term “thrashing” to refer to pretty much any situation where the system grinds to a halt because it’s entirely preoccupied with metawork.

In cases where we don’t have good priors, however, our predictions aren’t good. \[...\] This has a number of important implications. Our judgements betray our expectations, and our expectations betray our experience. What we project about the future reveals a lot - about the world we live in, and about our own past.

As the saying goes, “the most exciting phrase to hear in science, the one that heralds new discoveries, is not ‘Eureka!’ but ‘That’s funny.’”

When we need to make sense of, say, national health care reform - a vast apparatus too complex to be readily understood - our political leaders typically offer us two things: cherry-picked personal anecdotes and aggregative summary statistics. The anecdotes, of course, are rich and vivid, but they’re unrepresentative. Almost any piece of legislation, no matter how enlightened or misguided, will leave someone better off and someone worse off, so carefully selected stories don’t offer any perspective on broader patterns. Aggregative statistics, on the other hand, are the reverse: comprehensive but thin. \[...\] A statistic can only tell us part of the story, obscuring any underlying heterogeneity. And often we don’t even know which statistic we need.

The satirical “Peter Principle”, articulated in the 1960s by education professor Laurence J. Peter, states that “every employee tends to rise to his level of incompetence.”

Stuart Cheshire concurs that it’s high time for latency to become a top priority for network engineers. He’s appalled that companies who advertise “fast” internet connections refer only to high bandwidth, not to low delay. By analogy, he notes that a Boeing 737 and a Boeing 747 both fly at about five hundred miles per house; the former can hold 120 passenger, while the latter carries three times as many. So “would you say that a Boeing 747 is three times “faster” than a Boeing 737? Of course not.”

As odd as it may sound, the prisoner’s dilemma also has a lot to tell us about marriage.

Lest you think that civilised modern humans have legal contracts instead of retribution, recall that it’s often more work and suffering to sue or prosecute someone than the victim could ever hope to recover in material terms. Lawsuits are the means for self-destructive retaliation in a developed society, not the substitute.

Robert Frank: The worry that people will leave relationships because it may later become rational for them to do so is largely erased if it is not rational assessment that binds them in the first place. \[...\] Yes people search for objective characteristics they care about. Everybody wants somebody who’s kind and intelligent and interesting and healthy and maybe physically attractive, good earning power, the whole laundry list of features, but that’s the first pass… After you’ve spent enough time together, it’s not those things that make you want to stay together. It’s just the fact that it’s that particular person - that is what’s valuable to you, so you don’t really need the contract so much as you need a feeling that makes you not want to separate, even though objectively there might be a better option available to you.
