According to conventional wisdom, highly successful people have three things in common: motivation, ability, and opportunity. If we want to succeed, we need a combination of hard work, talent, and luck. The story of Danny Shader and David Hornik highlights a fourth ingredient, one that’s critical but often neglected: success depends heavily on how we approach our interactions with other people. Every time we interact with another person at work, we have a choice to make: do we try to claim as much value as we can, or contribute value without worrying about what we receive in return?

we rely on teams to build cars and houses, perform surgeries, fly planes, fight wars, play symphonies, produce news reports, audit companies, and provide consulting services. teams depend on givers to share information, volunteer for unpopular tasks, and provide help.

in 1993, a college student named Graham Spencer teamed up with five friends to build an Internet startup. Spencer was a shy, introverted computer engineer with a receding hairline, huge glasses, and an obsession with comic books. looking back, he says superman taught him justice, the x-men kindled concern for oppressed groups, and spiderman gave him hope: "even superheroes could have a rough time in school"

this is a new spin on reciprocity. in traditional old-school reciprocity, people operated like matchers, trading value back and forth with one another. we helped the people who helped us, and we gave to the people from whom we wanted something in return. but today, givers like adam rifkin are able to spark a more powerful form of reciprocity. instead of trading value, rifkin aims to add value. his giving is governed by a simple rule: the five minute favour. "You should be willing to do something that will take you five minutes or less for ANYBODY".

as with networking and collaboration, when it comes to discovering the potential in others, reciprocity styles shape our approaches and effectiveness

Simmons: "good givers are great getters; they make everybody better". "in selecting and promoting talent, the most important quality you can show me is a commitment to giving."

part of the reason intention questions work is that they elicit commitment. once people say yes, they feel compelled to follow through. but interestingly, research suggests that intention questions can work even when people initially say no. the question trigger reflection, and if the behaviour is attractive, some people change their mind and decide to do it.

when we give our time, energy, knowledge or resources to help others, we strive to maintain a belief that they're worthy and deserving of our help. seeking advice is a subtly way to invite someone to make a commitment to us.

\[...\] a remarkable principle of giver burnout: it has less to do with the amount of giving and more with the amount of feedback about the impact of that giving. \[...\] along with reducing burnout among givers, a firsthand connection to impact can tilt people of all reciprocity styles in the giver direction. when people know their work makes a difference, they feel energized to contribute more.

this is what i find most magnetic about successful givers: they get to the top without cutting others down, finding ways of expanding the pie that benefit themselves and the people around them.

we spend the majority of our waking hours at work. this means that what we do at work becomes a fundamental part of who we are. if we reserve giver values for our personal lives, what will be missing in our professional lives? by shifting ever so slightly in the giver direction, we might find our waking hours marked by greater success, richer meaning, and more lasting impact.
