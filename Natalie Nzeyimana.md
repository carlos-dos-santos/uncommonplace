By understanding work as part of a broader commitment to making the world more equitable, we can try to see ourselves simply as “workers” and focus on nourishing the other parts of our lives that make humans human. 

  

Your house renovation, your marriage, your friendships, your dogs, your hobbies, your practices of care, the work you do in the community, these are all wells to draw self-esteem/ hope/ courage/ confidence from

  

You are not your work. They don’t own you. They rent your time. Then you live your life.
