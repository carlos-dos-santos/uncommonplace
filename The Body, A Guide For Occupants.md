The great paradox of the brain is that everything you know about the world isprovided to you by an organ that has itself never seen that world. The brain exists in silence and darkness, like a dungeoned prisoner. It has no pain receptors, literally no feelings. It has never felt warm sunshine or a soft breeze. To your brain, the world is just a stream of electrical pulses, like taps of Morse code. And out of this bare and neutral information it creates for you - quite literally creates - a vibrant, three-dimensional, sensually engaging universe. Your brain IS you. Everything else is just plumbing and scaffolding.

What is surely most curious and extraordinary about our brain is how lagely unnecessary it is. To survive on Earth, you don't need to be able to write music or engage in philosophy - you really only need to be able to out-think a quadruped - so why have we invested so much energy and risk in producing mental capacity that we don't really need?    That is just one of the many things about your brain that your brain won't tell you. 

Thinking is our most vital and miraculous talent, yet in a profound physiological sense we don't really know what thinking is.

The biggest part of seeing isn't receiving visual images, it's making sense of them. 

What you see is not what is, but what your brain tells you it is, and that's not the same thing at all. 

As the French anatomist G.-B. Duchenne de Boulogne noticed as long ago as 1862, a genuine, spontaneous smile involves the contraction of the orbicularis oculi musicle in each eye and we have no independent control over these muscles. You can make your mouth smile, but you can't make your eyes sparkle with feigned joy.

To say that your body is your long-suffering servant is to put it mildly.

Insulin is a hormone. Hormones are the bicycle messengers of the body, delivering chemical messages all around the teeming metropolis that is you. #bicycles

In breathing, as in everything in life, the numbers are fantastical. #data

Cloning gives you the same thing over and over. Sex gives you Einstein and Rembrant - and a lot of dorks, too, of course. 

For millions of people, pain is a nightmare that cannot be escaped. #pain

The simple fact is that medical science alone cannot do it all - but then it doesn't need to. Other factors can significantly affect outcomes, sometimes in surprising ways. Just being kind, for instance. #science #kindness

In short, everyday attributes like empathy and common sense can be just as important as the most technologically sophisitcated equipment. #empathy

In 2011, an interesting milestone was passed. For the first time, more people died globally from non-communicable diseases like heart failure, stroke and diabetes than from all infections diseases combined. We live in an age in which we are killed, more often than not, by lifestyle. We are in effect choosing how we shall die, albeit without much reflection or insight. #progress

We have become much better at extending life, but not necessarily better at extending quality of life. #quality-of-life #ageing
