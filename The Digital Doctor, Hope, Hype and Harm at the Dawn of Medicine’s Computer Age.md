**Where are we in our journey toward digital healthcare that truly delivers value? I have come to see the computerization of healthcare as traversing four stages:  
1\. Digitizing the system

2\. Connecting all the pieces

3\. Making sense of all the digital data

4\. Building tools, systems, organizations, and a culture that take advantage of stages 1-3 to actually improve health and healthcare

  

During Burton’s years working at Otis, he had learned an important lesson: although his work was ostensibly about computers, cables, and controls, solving the technical puzzles wasn’t nearly as hard, or as important, as fixing the underlying business, cultural, and political problems. That’s what really determined how well the system worked.

  

“Medicine is the most information-rich, knowledge-intensive human activity, probably ever,” \[Burton\] said. \[...\] Buton and his team developed a patient summary screen that the NPs could fill in with just 25 clicks. This dramatically reduced the amount of time they spent competing their pre-rounds - from 35 minutes to less than 5. Not only did this free up huge chunks of their days, but it also liberated tons of cognitive space to actually think about the patients. As a result, the NPs made fewer mistakes. 

  

The only way to make a shift from volume to value, the Obama team believed, was to start with a wired healthcare system - one that tracked patients, measured outcomes, and detected and swiftly addressed instances in which people failed to receive the care they needed. 

  

Brailer is right. One of the great challenges in healthcare technology is that medicine is at once an enormous business and an exquisitely human endeavour; it requires the ruthless efficiency of the modern manufacturing plant and the gentle hand-holding of the parish priest; it is about science, but also about art; it is eminently quantifiable and yet stubbornly not. 

  

The role of the note is measures like mortality or hospital readmission rates (in other words, how patients fared \[“outcome measures”\] rather than what we did \[“process measures”\]) is subtler and involves a bit of math. But it is equally important in influencing our documentation.

  

Today, the average elderly patient in the United States sees seven physicians (two generalists and five specialists) in four different practices each year. While each new doctor adds expertise, from the patient’s vantage point, the end result is often cacophony. 

  

The provision of healthcare is remarkably information-intensive. A large healthcare system processes about 10 million computerized transactions each day, twice the number of transactions that takes place every day on NASDAQ. And the average 4 night stay at a large teaching hospital like mine is accompanied by close to 400 orders (for medications, tests, diet, even whether patients are allowed to walk to the bathroom), each an opportunity for error.

  

Hari Tsoukas, an expert in organizational studies at the University of Cypress, highlights the difference between information and knowledge. Information, he wrote, “consists of objectified, decontextualized, time-less, impersonal, value-free representations,” whereas knowledge is “context-dependent, personalized, time-bound, and infused with values”.

  

Relational coordination, \[Judy Hoffer Gittell\] has found, is crucial in environments characterized by task interdependence, uncertainty, and time constraints. \[...\] The “inefficiency” of maintaining these personal relationships paid off.

  

Michael Leavitt, US Secretary of Health and Human Services (2005): “We have the capacity to transform health with one thunderous click of a mouse after another”

  

In 2012, I wrote that the electronic medical record needed one more field, which I called the uber-assessment field. A mouse-over would reveal its instructions: “In this field, please tell the many people who are coming to see your patients - nurses, nutritionalists, social workers, consultants, your attending - what the hell is going on. What are the major issues you’re trying to address and the questions you’re struggling to answer? Describe the patients trajectory - is he or she getting better or worse? If worse (or not better), what are you doing to figure things out, and when might you rethink your diagnosis or your therapeutic approach and try something new? Please DO NOT use this space to restate the narrow, one-problem-at-a-time oriented approach you have so competently articulated in other parts of this record. We know that the patient has hypokalemia and that your plan is to replace the potassium. Use this section to be more sympathetic, more novelistic, more imaginative, more expansive. Tell a story.”

  

Building and installing a healthcare IT system is so complicated that nobody can reasonably expect perfection straight out of the box. Precisely because of this, it’s vital that both vendors and IT departments welcome feedback and respond to it appropriately. 

  

In healthcare, the arguments are particularly interesting and charged because of the height of the stakes, the complexity of the human condition, and medicines unique demands to blend the technical, scientific, matters of diagnosis and treatment with deeply moral and philosophical questions that are not really in play when the challenge is finding a hotel room, picking a stock, or making a left turn. 

  

And, of course, the outputs of all these miraculous devices can now connect to our smartphones and to the internet. This means that the so-called Quantified Self movement is shifting from a technical problem (how to capture the data) into an analytics question (how to make sense of the data). And this is where the hope butts up against the hype. 

  

Ebadollahi sees such an approach, sometimes called “practice-based evidence” as complementing, not supplanting, the more traditional “evidence-based practice”, with its focus on using published clinical research to guide prognosis and treatments. 

  

Much of the data in EHRs continues to be collected for the purpose of creating a superior bill, and using this waste product of administrative functions for clinical decision making can lead to a GIGO (garbage in, garbage out) problem, even with fabulous analytics.

  

\[on swiss cheese error modelling\] Reason’s model reminds us that most errors are caused by good, competent people who are trying to do the right thing, and that bolstering the system - shrinking the holes in the Swiss cheese or adding overlapping layers - is generally far more productive that trying to purge the system of human error, an impossibility.

  

Delbanco - “Patients possess a body of knowledge about themselves that we can never hope to master, and we have a body of knowledge about medicine that they can never hope to master. Our job is to bring these two groups together so we can serve each other well.”

  

It’s not the sexiest of approaches, but this may well be a case in which a slow, steady march toward the goal of total interoperability is likelier to reach the finish line than an undisciplined, crowd-pleasing sprint.

  

It’s worth highlighting \[...\] that the virtual community has some distinct advantages over an in-person community. In addition to allowing for far-flung relationships (Trevor and Neilwere extraordinarily close, though one lives in Maryland and the other in Scotland), people post things they would never say to someone else. 

  

Don Berwick, former head of Medicare and founder of the Institute for Healthcare Improvement, once described a thought experiment that captures the importance of integration. Imagine, he said, that you’re trying to assemble the world’s best car by using the best parts. You’d connect the engine of a Ferrari, the brakes of a Porsche, the suspension of a BMW, and the body of a Volvo. “What we’d get, of course, is nothing close to a great car,” he said. “We’d get a pile of very expensive junk.”

  

Nate Gross: “It may be easier to teach a techie healthcare than to teach a doctor tech”

  

The history of technology tells us that it is \[...\] financial, environmental, and organizational factors, rather than the digital wizardry itself, that determines the success and impact of new IT tools. This phenomenon is known as the productivity paradox of information technology. 

  

Brynjolfsson, seminal 1993 article, coiner of the phrase “productivity paradox”; two main theories: First, our systems for measuring productivity weren’t up to the task. Second, like a safe-deposit box, unlocking IT’s potential requires the turning of two keys - the technology itself and the redesign of the surrounding environment. 

  

Today as ever, changing the way that work is done is often determines whether an organization will get its money’s worth from its IT investment. But the temptation to simply electronify the old process is powerful. 

  

It turns out that new technologies always rearrange social relationships - and that effective organizations remain vigilant for problems flowing from these changes and work doggedly to mitigate them.

  

We do nothing like \[what the aviation industry does\] in healthcare, partly because those who build the computer systems can’t easily test them in the diverse organizations in which they will be deployed (from rural clinics to large urban academic medical centres), and partly because the EHRs are trying to satisfy so many different audiences and demands. But no other mission should trump the mission of making healthcare safe. And the only way to achieve this goal is to make aviation-style integrated field testing a standard part of healthcare automation. 

  

In fact, I am convinced that the human side of medicine will be nurtured in the digital era only if both patients and clinicians value it and demand it. 

  

In his book Smarter Than You Think, Clive Thompson endorsed this idea, making a forceful case that people working collaboratively with technology are far more effective than either people or technology alone. This has been shown persuasively not only in chess (“Human strategic guidance combined with the tactical acuity of a computer was overwhelming,” said grandmaster Garry Kasparov after a 1998 “collaborative chess competition”), but also in many other fields. 

  

It will take great discipline and all the professionalism we can muster to remember, in a healthcare world now bathed in digital data, that we are taking care of human beings. The iPatient can be useful as a way of representing a set of facts and problems, and big data can help us analyze them and better appreciate our choices. But ultimately, only the real patient counts, and only the real patient is worthy of our full attention.
