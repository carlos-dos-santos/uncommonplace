when auri woke on the fourth day, things had changed. she could tell before she stretched awake. before she cracked her eyes into the seamless dark.\[…\] she knew what it could be like. some days simply lay on you like stones. some were as fickle as cats, sliding away when you needed comfort, then coming back later when you didn’t want them, jostling at you, stealing your breath. 

occasionally something goes wrong with the tiny bodies balancing the perceptual pressures on the human brain. often the governmental and diplomatic matrix cannot handle the pressures of the world they govern. 

the letters \[in English\] don’t have nothing to do with the sounds you make

that’s why english was such a fine language for novels. but i oversimplify.
