Coleridge, apparently, used to go to scientific lectures to renew his stock of metaphors, and while I would never dream of saying that the main function of science is the production of metaphors for subsequent development in the arts, science IS damned useful to steal from.

The mind has plenty of ways of preventing you from writing,Â  and paralysing self-consciousness is a good one. The only thing to do is ignore it, and remember what Vincent van Gogh said in one of his letters about the painter's fear of the blank canvas - the canvas, he said, is far more afraid of the painter.

In my experience film people talk a lot more about story than book people do , and I'm always interested to hear what they have to say.

David Mamet - "where do I put the camera?"
#perception

I think that's THE basic storytelling question. Where do you see the scene from? What do you tell the reader about it? What's your stance towards the characters?

Innocence is not wise; wisdom cannot be innocent. And it's very painful and it's very hard, but it's the only way forward, and in the end, if we keep on trying, we shall have acquired a deeper, fuller, richer understanding than we ever had before we tasted the fruit of the knowledge of good and evil.

If you want to write something perfect, go for a haiku.
#perfection

It was a time when I discovered poetry and painting. It was like discovering a new continent - new forms of knowledge, new ways of understanding, immense vistas of possibility.

Knowledge comes with a cost \[...\] If we want the knowledge that comes with experience, we have to leave the innocence behind.

A poem is not a lecture; a story is not an argument. The way poems and stories work on our minds is not by logic, but by their capacity to enchant, to excite, the move, to inspire. To be sure, a sound intellectual underpinning helps the work to stand up under intellectual questioning, as Paradise Lost certainly does; but its primary influence is on the imagination.
#imagination

Humans are able to think about their world and describe it in more ways than one, and a very great gift that is.
#anthropology 

We sometimes forget how lucky we are to live in this little bubble of time which is still warmed, you could say, by the background radiation from the Enlightenment. We're priviliged to be able to hear the words of Professor Hawking without having to meet in secret, without having to depend on passwords and disguises, without the danger of betrayal and arrest and torture; and that is not only because of the intellectual brilliance of the great heroes of science, both past and present, but because of their valour too.
#bravery 

The commonest question writers get asked is: where do you get your ideas from? The truthful answer is: I dunno. They just turn up.

Somehow it isn't surprising at all to find that lengthy and passionate discussion among literary critics has not the slightest influence on the way most readers read most books.
#perception 

And I try to explain something about the democratic nature of reading. I say that whatever my intention might have been when I wrote the book, the meaning doesn't consist only of my intention. The meaning is what emerges from the interaction between the words I put on the page and the readers' own minds as they read them. If they're puzzled, the best thing to do is talk about the book with someone else who's read it, and let meanings emerge from the conversation, democratically. I'm willing to take part in such conversations, because I too have read the book, and if I'm asked about my intentions, then any answer I give will be part of the conversation too; but it's hard to persuade readers that my reading has no more final authority than theirs.
#reading #intent 

When we say "this book is for such-and-such a group", what we seem to be saying, what we're HEARD as saying, is: "this book is not for anyone else".
#diversity 

According to Rawls, the 'original position' is the state in which we are to imagine ourselves behind a veil of ignorance, without knowing what position in society we actually occupy.  

\[stories as treasure\] But treasure should not be hoarded. This is for spending. And the strangest thing of all about this sort of treasure is that the more you give away, the more you have left.
#treasure #generosity

But stories are not made of language. I don't think they're made of any of the media in which they may happen to be transmitted. I'm going to say straight out that I think stories are made of events, and that the fundamental particles of story are the smallest events we can find.
#language

Fundamental particles like the pouring-from-a-container idea are sometimes known as image schemas. My interest in this was sparked by the work of George Lakoff and Mark Turner and Mark Thompson and other cognitive linguists, but in my butterfly way I've cheerfully taken what I want from their work and carried it away to do something else with it.
#cognition #linguistics 

As the great scholar of symbols and iconography Ernst Gombrich says, 'Our language favours this twilight region between the literal and the metaphorical. Who can always tell where one ends and the other begins?'
#symbols

Work without inspiration is possible, of course. The only way to become a professional artist of any sort is to learn how to work efficiently when you're not feeling inspired in the least.
#inspiration

I believe the narrator is not actually a human character at all, and his or her relationship to time is one of the ways his or her uncanny inhumanness is manifest.

If you're reading like this, no one else matters at all. The obsessive, merciless, solitary, amoral, almost savage devouring of a text to the obliteration of everything else is something we all, if we're honest, have experienced at some point.
#obsession #experience

As William Blake pointed out, you never know what is enough unless you know what is more than enough.
#abundance 

\[Robert Burton on\] the importance of light and fellowship: 'wax candles in the night, near chambers, good fires in winter, merry companions, for though melancholy persons love to be dark and alone, yet darkness is a great increaser of the humour'.
#darkness #friendship 

'if there be a hell upon earth, it is to be found in a melancholy man's heart' \[...\] the word depression has always seemed to me far too genteel, too decorous for this savage and merciless torment.
#depression #suffering 

Burton ends his stupendous work with the excellent advice: "Be not solitary; be not idle". This is a great direction, says Johnson, but he would modify it thus: "If you are idle, be not solitary; if you are solitary, be not idle."
#solitariness 

So, finally: do you need a theory of human nature in order to write stories? I think you need a theory of your own nature. But that's not so easy to come by as you might think. You can spend years, for instance, thinking that you're interested in something, only to discover eventually that you were never really interested; you just thought you should be. Self-knowledge is hard won.

The physicist Steven Weinberg says, 'The more we understand about the universe, the more it seems to be utterly pointless.'

It's never a waste of time to look honestly at human experience.
