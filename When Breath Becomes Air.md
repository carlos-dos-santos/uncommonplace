Literature not only illuminated another's experience, it provided, I believed, the richest material for moral reflection.

  

If the unexamined life was not worth living, was the unlived life worth examining?

  

I had come to see language as an almost supernatural force, existing between people, bringing our brains, shielded in centimeter-thick skulls, into communion. A word meant something only between two people, and life's meaning, its virtue, had something to do with the depth of the relationships we form.

  

While all doctors treat diseases, neurosurgeons work in the crucible of identity: every operation on the brain is, by necessity, a manipulation of the substance of our selves, and every conversation with a patient undergoing brain surgery cannot help but confront this fact.

  

At those critical junctures, the question is not simply whether to live or die but what kind of life is worth living.

  

As a resident, my highest ideal was not saving lives - everyone dies eventually - but guiding a patient or family to an understanding of death or illness.

  

The call to protect life - and not merely life but another's identity; it is perhaps not too much to say another's soul - was obvious in its sacredness. Before operating on a patient's brain, I must first understand his mind: his identity, his values, what makes his life worth living, and what devastation makes it reasonable to let that life end. The cost of my dedication to succeed was high, and the ineluctable failures brought me nearly unbearable guilt. Those burdens are what makes medicine holy and wholly impossible. in taking up another's cross, one must sometimes get crushed by the weight.

  

Certain brain areas are considered near-invoiable, like the primary motor cortex, damage to which results in paralysis of affected body parts. But the most sacrosanct regions of the cortex are those that control language. Usually located on the left side, they are called Wernicke's and Broca's areas; one is for understanding language and the other for producing it. Damage to Broca's area results in an inability to speak or write, though the patient can easily understand language. Damage to Wernicke's area results in an inability to understand language; though the patient can still speak, the language she produces is a stream of unconnected words, phrases, and images, a grammar without semantics. If bothÂ  areas are damaged, the patient becomes an isolate, something central to her humanity stolen forever. After someone suffers a head trauma or a stroke, the destruction of these areas often restrains the surgeon's impulse to save a life: What kind of life exists without language?

  

As I started reading about chemo, which included a whole variety of agents, and a raft of more modern novel treatments that targeted specific mutations, the sheer number of questions I had prevented any useful directed study. (Alexander Pope: "A little learning is a dangerous thing;/ Drink deep, or taste not the Pierian spring")

  

Death may be a one-time event, but living with terminal illness is a process

  

If I no longer sought to fly on the highest trajectory of neurosurgeon and neuroscientist, what did I want? To be a father? To be a neurosurgeon? To teach? I didn't know. But if I did not know what I wanted, I had learned something not found in Hippocrates, Maimonides, or Osler: the physician's duty is not to stave off death or return patients to their old lives, but to take into our arms a patient and family whose lives have disintegrated and work until they can stand back up and face, and make sense of, their own existence.

  

"Paul, after you die, your family will fall apart, but they'll pull it back together because of the example of bravery you set."

  

"Bereavement is not the truncation of married love," C. S. Lewis wrote, "but one of its regular phases - like the honeymoon. What we want is to live our marriage well and faithfully through that phase too."
