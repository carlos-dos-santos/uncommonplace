The earlier it is introduced, the easier the fit with the routines of everyday life. In almost all cases where dementia has been diagnosed, the problems are already advancing and the SPECAL method is your best chance of nurturing lifelong well-being.

Feeling good, but not knowing why, is quite a different proposition from feeling bad and not knowing why.

Think feelings, not facts. \[...\] Never forget that feelings and non-verbal communication are much more important to the client than normal, and they become ever more so as the illness progresses. Never mind the facts, feel the feelings - that must be your motto.

\[PWD\] badly need reassurance of their own personal worth, something that has been slipping away from them since the diagnosis.

Of course, all of us must necessarily sometimes lead conversations in normal life in the directions that we want them to go; as T. S. Eliot put it, in order to join normal social exchanges you must ‘put on a face to meet the faces that you meet.’
