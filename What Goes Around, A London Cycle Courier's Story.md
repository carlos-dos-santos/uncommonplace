Humanity will always find a foothold, I remind myself, no matter how apparently inhospitable the conditions

His face instantly animated into its usual toothy grin, a parabola of wrinkles stretching up his cheeks to his eyes, showing just how regularly this grin had been deployed over the last couple of decades.

'I don't have a lot of family,' she mused. 'I've always felt like I needed to be somewhere where I was surrounded by people who just accepted me and were welcoming, and that's one of the things the courier scene does really well, is that it picks up waifs and strays like me and makes them feel less... waify or strayey.' \[...\] I remembered the over-confident, privately educated young men who had persistently shouted me down at Cambridge, and who, even though I had eventually learned to shout back, had instilled the firm conviction in me that this was THEIR place, THEIR culture, THEIR rules. The degree I'd come out with was ultimately no more than a language I'd learned to speak, however fluently, whereas couriering was something I'd built from scratch, and owned as much as anyone else who had ever strapped a radio to their bag and scraped a living in the streets

Fantasies aren't supposed to come true - and when they do, it's best not to push it

This is, in fact, possibly the first time I've told the two stories as they happened, interlaced, entwined, interlocked, just like the rest of London is, whether we're able to notice it or not.

Fantastical queer urban landscape \[...\] I gradually began to capture a comparable sense of there being a lot more simmering under the surface than most people would ever suspect, visible, audible, and tangible if you knew what you were looking for, but non-existent if you didn't.

\[places in London\] where I have piled up so many memories over the years that strolling from the National Theatre along to the London Eye is like jostling through a crowd of ex-girlfriends and lovers.

I imagined the line I'd drawn through \[London\] with my wheels over the past few years, all tangled up like someone's unravelled knitting, and wondered how it might look if I were to stretch it out to its full extent

It's curious - although I frequently credit my years as a courier with teaching me to think (and to observe, and engage with the world) like never before, much of the satisfaction of the job comes from the irreverence of thought; the joy of watching your body develop its own intelligence; the satisfaction of subordinating reason to instinct.

I would miss this, when I left, I thought - this comforting coincidence, this sense of the city perpetually resolving its own chaos. But I was also missing the sense of discovery from my earlier days on the road; the feeling of striking out into darkness; the nebulous and fearful savour of direction without destination. I was ready for a new circuit.

... There was more to it, but I found myself drifting off at that point, captivated by the idea of pinning one's emotions (intentionally or otherwise) to physical actions and places, since that's what I do all the time. Of all my many maps of London, the emotional one is the most elusive, but also the most powerful. The unlikeliest street corners will have some tattered threads of memory fluttering from them like a flag, because of something I did there once, or someone I spoke to, or simply because of something I happened to be thinking as I rode past one day, which then popped back into my mind as I rode past again a few hours later, and after that was forever lying in wait for me on that particular corner, like a swarm of insects, or the gust of hot fragrant air that I savour every time I ride past the bakery on Brockley Road. It's almost as if the memories have overflowed from my head and scattered themselves about the city - or as if London itself has become an extension of my consciousness. Some parts of my life I can recall simply by thinking of them; others I think I'd remember better if I went back to a certain part of London and plucked them up from the tree I'd hung them from, or retraced them from the park bench I'd scratched them on, or snatched them up as they blew around in circles in an alleyway like a discarded carrier bag. \[The grief of that breakup\] abated eventually, as I knew it would, but a few strands of it were still strung across the entrance to the park like cobwebs on an autumn morning, and that evening I forgot to duck, and rode straight into them.
