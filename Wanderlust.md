The possibilities were too tempting to ignore. For what might happen if I embarked on such an adventure? What might unfold if I were to step outside of the box and wander and flirt with the land in a spirit of playful experimentation? #play #nature #magic #exploration #discovery 

For if I was going to do this, I'd need to enter fully into the spirit of my endeavour. Anything less would be a tepid charade, an exercise for my mind and not my heart. And I wanted what my heart wanted. #committment #cartesian-duality 

The sea always feels like a homecoming, replenishing, like a date with a briny divinity; I long to be near it - it my head the sea is often a sinuous 'she' - even though I can't treat water and am afraid of riptides and killer surf. #the-sea #home 

Feelings are like that: ungovernable, inexplicable, at odds with the rational. #emotion #rationality

An empty house with a full fridge, and the sea - I want for nothing. #home #solitariness 

I think of all the things people have called me in the past - 'woo woo', 'hippie', 'eccentric' - and mentally I thumb my nose at all of them. Life is too short to care what others think of you. If I live in the cracks, if I fall between camps, if I have a foot in a few worlds but don't fully belong to a single one and am part of no clique, I'll make the outlier world my home, a desirable place to be, I tell myself. Others can find me here if they want to. #solitariness #self #self-worth #punk #outsider

I have always felt uncomfortable with the whole 'native' and 'non-native' trees talk. If you were to replace the word 'tree' with people it would all start to sound ominous. It may feel invasive, but it's hardly the fault of the tree. It is only doing what it is hardwired to do: grow. I know that native species are a part of the local ecosystem and have lived for thousands of years in perfect harmony with their environment. A non-native tree is a foreigner tree, an outlier, an interloper. I know the mantra - I've heard it intoned often enough. #self-and-other #evolution 

A journey on foot, a slow, thoughtful, reverent walk to a special place, or to no fixed destination - undertaken alone, a pilgrimage is almost like a vision quest in motion. The inner journey is an important as the outer, you set an intention and consider what you want to honour or invoke. You could even call it a form of spellcasting, and there is something beautiful in breath and air coming together in this way. #paul-kalanithi #magic #nature #intent 

We're only a few hours out of London and I'm astonished to see the stars. What we miss, in the city, with our veil of pollution. #london #stars 

'To even make sense of any of this you have to be on board with the idea of the imagination as a collective field, rather than something that just resides in our heads. The spirit of the head, the genuis loci is part of that collective imaginal world.' #imagination #community #social-networks #nature 

'Look, it doesn't matter if you don't get it. None of this fits easily into the boxes that currently exist. What does matter is that the walks I lead are offering people the enchantment they are - we are all - hungering for. The land is a playground for the imagination,' he says, emphasising again that imagination doesn't mean 'made up' but something bigger. 

Karis: 'Rain gives a voice to everything it touches. When it rains, the woodland sings. Each leaf sounds a note in this symphony, and the contours of the body of trees reveals itself.' #music #rain 

What is a landscape if you can't see it? #sight #the-senses

'In a natural state' is what springs to mind. But what does 'wild' mean to me? Going feral? Living in tune with the rhythms of nature? Following your desires? Liberating yourself from the fear and expectations of others? If so, this year I'm living wilder than I ever have. And what does 'nature' mean? Everything that's not man-mad? The natural world, including humans? #nature #humans-and-machines 

Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance: Buddha is not to be found only in the petals of a flower, but also in the circuits of a computer.

As we walk (with my eyes closed), I try to shift to a loer centre of gravity, like a dancer might. When I do, it's like I have a second brain down there, guiding me. #cartesian-duality #sense-making 

We don't listen to each other enough in this modern world and we don't listen to the murmurings of the land. Every tree, every leaf, every ray of sunlight, every bird, every creature is reaching out to us in their language. #communication #language #connection #listening
