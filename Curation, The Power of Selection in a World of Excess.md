We have been conditioned for hundreds of years to put primacy on activities and businesses that they create more stuff. Where business used to want more, now they should want better. Abundance was the goal, now it’s the problem to be solved. When the problems change, so should we. 

  

This is where the value of curation starts to become clear. In a world of too much data, having the right data is valuable. In a world where we don’t have any time, choosing the right thing to do is valuable. 

  

Growth can come from adding value, not adding more.

  

The Long Boom means there is more of everything, whether data, debt or doughnuts. It doesn’t mean life is easier or better. In an overloaded world, the locus of value is shifting. 

  

Curation is about selecting. But also about arranging, refining, simplifying and contextualising. Schwartz’s solution to what he calls the paradox of choice is that we ‘learn to love constraints’. Although we think of constraints as negative they can be helpful, even liberating. Curation produces such constraints. It limits us, but productively. 

  

The value of curation is never just about selection. It’s about knowledgeable selection, knowledge you can’t fake. It’s this mastery which makes curation so significant. 

  

Curation is, in part, about what machines cannot do. 

  

If you want to find something, search is the key. If you want to discover, then it’s about curation. 

  

Life throws these things into place. Curation cultivates them into being. Arrangement, and by extension curation, is about transforming the impact of relationships - not just amongst people but images, words, ideas, groceries, historical curios, anything at all. Curators find and establish relationships. They are matchmakers, contrasters, minglers, pattern-spotters and pattern-producers - people who can see, understand and interpret the gestalt and in doing so create a new one. 

  

Selection works by taking away. Arrangement is a subtler shift; it makes the most of what you have. 

  

How we arrange things - experiences, merchandise in shops, forms, gallery exhibitions, web pages, information, food on a plate - makes a big difference. This is true at the deepest level. 

  

The curation of identity is built on growing individualism.But it is all undergirded by the growth in choice. 

  

‘Trouble with running a business is that whatever you do - whatever targets you hit, however quickly you scale - you always need to do more. There is never a moment when everyone stops and thinks, yup, that’s pretty good. It’s relentless. That’s the deal.’

  

Benjamin Hardy: “Your input shapes your outlook. And your outlook shapes your behaviour.”
