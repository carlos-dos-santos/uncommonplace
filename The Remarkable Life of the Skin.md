Skin is both a barrier against the terrors of the outside world and - with millions of nerve endings to help us feel our way through life - a bridge into our very being.

Although science still hasn’t pinned down the exact molecules that may influence perceived attractiveness, humans are nevertheless exquisitely proficient at detecting their partner’s “odour print”. A prolonged sniff of your loved one will trigger happy memories and reduce stress levels.

A glut of flawless complexions is thrown at us every day through television, while social media reinforces that, in our uncertain world, we can control our destiny by controlling our appearance. It would be easy to say that our anti-ageing culture is unhealthy and we should all simply embrace our wrinkles, but it’s not as simple as that. Our skin in our self, and changing the way we see our skin is essentially changing part of our very being. Our society reveres the young, so the desire to keep the skin as youthful and healthy-looking as possible is understandable and it can be very difficult to see the positives of old age. 

The people of Huxley’s dystopian vision were taught to reset age and pretend they were not going to die. Should wrinkles be ‘cured’ or should we be having a discussion in society about how we view age? In a world that likes to pretend decline and death don’t exist, our skin urges us to confront our mortality.

Pain, although unpleasant, is a vital warning sign of tissue damage and we cannot live without it. There are also people who acquire insensitivity to skin pain as a result of disease. A leprosy I men could not feel with the tips of his fingers, and repeated unnoticed injuries has left him physically deformed. He told me: “I would rather feel everything than feel the agony of the shame.” Pain is necessary for life, in every sense of the word. 

The physical distance between the skin and the brain, however, is also a philosophical one. We like to think that we see and feel the world directly, but much of the picture of the world our mind constructs is in fact a necessary illusion. 

\[...\] It’s clear that physical touch is necessary for good physical and emotional health. It is a language of love and compassion, and it is critical for human development.

At the other end of the spectrum, it has been discovered that touching people with Alzheimer’s disease helps them make better emotional connections with others and dampens the symptoms of this devastating disease.
