Understanding habits is the most important thing I’ve learned in the army,” the major told me. “\[...\] I’m telling you, if a hick like me can learn this stuff, anyone can. I tell my soldiers all the time, there’s nothing you can’t do if you get the habits right.”

But the reason the discovery of the habit loop is so important is that it reveals a basic truth: when a habit emerges, the brain stops fully participating in decision making. It stops working so hard, or diverts focus to other tasks. So unless you deliberately fight a habit - unless you find new routines - the pattern will unfold automatically. 

“The problem is that your brain can’t tell the difference between bad and good habits, and so if you have a bad one, it’s always lurking there, waiting for the right cues and rewards” - Ann Graybiel

Eugene showed that habits, as much as memory and reason, are at the root of how we behave. We might not remember the experiences that create our habits, but once they are lodged within our brains they influence how we act - often without our realisation. 

When people join groups where change seems possible, the potential for change to occur becomes more real. For most people who overhaul their lives, there are no seminal moments of life-altering disasters. There are simply communities - sometimes of just one other person - who make change believable. 

Cultures grow out of the keystone habits in every organisation, whether leaders are aware of them or not. \[...\] There are no organisations without institutional habits. There are only places where they are deliberately designed, and places where they are created without forethought, so often they grow from rivalries or fear. 

“Self-discipline has a bigger effect on academic performance than does intellectual talent.” - UPenn researchers 2005

“Willpower isn’t a skill. It’s a muscle, like the muscles in your arms and legs, and it gets tired as it works harder, so there’s less power left over for other things” - Muraven

Starbucks taught their employees how to handle moments of adversity by giving them willpower habit loops. 

Howard Schultz - “I’ve been really lucky \[...\] and I really, genuinely believe that if you tell people that they have what it takes to succeed, they’ll prove you right.”

(re: onboarding documents) Now, imagine what you would tell a new colleague who asked for advice about how to succeed at your firm. Your recommendations probably wouldn’t contain anything you’d find in the company’s handbook. Instead, the tips you would pass on \[...\] are the habits you rely on every day to survive \[at work\].

“It’s excruciating to admit a mistake publicly,” said Dr Donald Moorman, until recently Beth Israel Deaconess’s associate surgeon in chief. “Twenty years ago, doctors wouldn’t do it. But a real sense of panic has spread through hospitals now, and even the best surgeons are willing to talk about how close they came to a big error. The culture of medicine is changing.”

Good leaders seize crises to remake organisational habits. \[...\] “You never want a serious crisis to go to waste” - Rahm Emanuel

A movement starts because of the social habits of friendship and the strong ties between close acquaintances. \[...\] In the playground, peer pressure is dangerous. In adult life, it’s how business gets done and communities self-organise. \[...\] Movements don’t emerge because everyone suddenly decides to face the same direction at once. They rely on social patterns that begin as the habits of friendship, grow through the habits of communities, and are sustained by new habits that change participants’ sense of self. 

If you believe you can change - if you make it a habit - the change becomes real. This is the real power of habit: the insight that your habits are what you choose them to be. 

The way we habitually think of our surroundings and ourselves create the worlds that each of us inhabit.
