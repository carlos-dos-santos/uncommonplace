Earl Moncrief, the butler, built his financial, procurement, and secret service organisations with the brute power of cash and a profound understanding of the clever, malicious, discontented people who lived behind servile facades. It was such people who took the Martian money and the Martian orders gladly. They asked no questions. They were grateful for the opportunity to work like termites on the sills of the established order. They came from all walks of life. 

Oh, Mankind, rejoice in the apathy of our Creator, for it makes us free and truthful and dignified at last. 

The surface of Earth heaved and seethed in fecund restlessness. Earth was most fertile where the most death was. 

All living things were brothers, and all dead things were even more so. 

His poor soul was flooded with pleasure as he realised that one friend was all that a man needed in order to be well-supplied with friendship. 

Salo was inspired to make so many statues by the showy ways in which Earthlings behaved. It wasn't so much what the Earthlings did as the way they did it that inspired Salo. The Earthlings behaved at all times as though there were a big eye in the sky - as though that big eye were ravenous for entertainment. The big eye was a glutton for great theatre. The big eye was indifferent as to whether the Earthling shows were comedy, tragedy, farce, satire, athletics, or vaudeville. Its demand, which Earthlings apparently found as irresistible as gravity, was that the shows be great. The demand was so powerful that Earthlings did almost nothing but perform for it, night and day - even in their dreams. The big eye was the only audience that Earthlings really cared about. The fanciest performances that Salo had seen had been put on by Earthlings who were terribly alone. The imagined big eye was their only audience. 

'My mate died today,' said Constant.  
'Sorry,' said Salo. 'I would say "Is there anything I can do?" - but Skip told me once that that was the most hateful and stupid expression in the English language.'  
Constant rubbed his hands together. The only company he had left on Titan was whatever company his right hand could be for his left. 'I miss her,' he said.
