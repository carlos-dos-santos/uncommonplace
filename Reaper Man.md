It began to dawn on Windle that the human body is not run by the brain, despite the brain's opinion on the matter. In fact it's run by dozens of complex automatic systems, all whirring and clicking away with the kind of precision that isn't noticed until it breaks down.

And it suddenly dawned on the late Windle Poons that there was no such things as somebody else's problem, and that just when you thought the world had pushed you aside it turned out to be full of strangeness. He knew from experinece that the living never found out half of what was really happening, because they were too busy being the living. The onlooker sees most of the game, he told himself. It was the living who ignored the strange and wonderful, because life was too full of the boring and mundane. But it was strange. It had things in it like screws that unscrewed themselves, and little messages written to the dead. #life-and-death #perception 

I've never been very sure about what is right, said Bill Door. I am not sure there is such a thing as right. Or wrong. Just places to stand. #relative-correctness #ethics 

The circular nature of Windle Poons' death didn't bother him much. After all, trees looked dead in the winter, burst forth again every spring. Dried up old seeds went in thr ground, fresh young plants sprang up. Practically nothing ever died for long. Take compost, for example. Modo believed in compost with the same passion that other people believed in gods. #gardening #nature #religion #faith #life-and-death 

Belief is one of the most powerful organic forces in the multiverse. It may not be able to move mountains, exactly. But it can create someone who can. #faith #power 

Was that really what it was like to be alive? The feeling of darkness dragging you forward? How could they live with it? And yet they did, and even seemed to find enjoyment in it, when surely the only sensible course would be to despair. Amazing. To feel you were a tiny living thing, sandwiched between two sliffs of darkness. How could they stand to be alive? Obviously it was something you had to be born to do. #the-lived-experience 

If people knew when they were going to die, I think they probably wouldn't live at all. 

He could look at emotions laid out like trapped butterflies, pinned on cork, under glass. #emotion #self-awareness
