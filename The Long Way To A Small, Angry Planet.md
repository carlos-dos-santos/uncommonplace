After a life in her parents’ enormous home, full of furniture and knick-knacks and rarities, the knowledge that she didn’t need anything more than what she could carry gave her a remarkable sense of freedom.

Perhaps the ache of homesickness was a fair price to pay for having so many good people in her life.

Friends are great, but they come and go. Lovers are fun, but kind of stupid, too. They say stupid things to each other and they ignore all their friends because they’re too busy staring, and they get jealous, and they have fights over dumb shit like who did the dishes last or why they can’t fold their fucking socks, and maybe the sex gets bad, or maybe they stop finding each other interesting, and then somebody bangs someone else, and everyone cries, and they see each other years later, and that person you once shared everything with is a total stranger you don’t even want to be around because it’s awkward. But brothers. Brothers never go away. That’s for life.
