The world is full of power and energy and a person can go far by just skimming off a tiny bit of it. 

They more or less ignore what is being said - a lot gets lost in translation, after all. They pay attention to the facial expressions and body language of the people they are talking to. And that’s how they know what’s going on inside a person’s head - by consending fact from the vapor of nuance.

“There are two schools: relativists and universalists. As George Sterner summarizes it, relativists tend to believe that language is not the vehicle of thought but its determining medium. It is the framework of cognition. Our perceptions of everything are organised by the flux of sensations passing over that framework. Hence, the study of the evolution of language is the study of the evolution of the human mind itself.” - the Librarian
