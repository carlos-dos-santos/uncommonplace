By trusting my inner dynamism, my conatus - by trusting the life that still carries me - i could emerge from the bog of my depression.

There is no question of "burdening the visual field" with images attesting to the inevitable losses and degradations of the "fourth age" - an age which is systematically associated with illness, ugliness, mental decline, isolation, boredom, and uselessness. Old people are alone, ill, and are going to die. And because the elderly are no longer productive, because their strength is declining and they no longer say much, because they have no political weight, do not defend their rights, and do not make themselves heard, we end up regarding them as worthless. The entire tragedy of old people's sadness derives from the shame they feel at being old and diminished, the feeling that they are no longer loveable, and that they inspire disgust and fear in others.
