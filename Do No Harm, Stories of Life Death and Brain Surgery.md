\[the operation involved\] the brain, the mysterious substrate of all thought and feeling, of all that was important in human life - a mystery, it seemed to me, as great, as the stars at night and the universe around us.

As a practical brain surgeon I have always found the philosophy of the so-called "Mind-Brain Problem" confusing and ultimately a waste of time. It has never seemed a problem to me, only a source of awe, amazement and profound surprise that my consciousness, my veryÂ  sense of self, the self which feels as free as air, which was trying to read through the book but instead was watching the clouds through the high windows, the self which is now writing these words, is in fact the electrochemical chatter of one hundred billion nerve cells.

I told her that what the family wanted would be entirely determined by what she said to them. If she said 'we can operate and remove the damaged brain and he may just survive', they were bound to say that we should operate. If, instead, she said 'if we operate there is no realistic chance of his getting back to an independent life. he will be left profoundly disabled. would he want to survive like that?' the family would probably give an entirely different answer. What she was really asking them was 'do you love him enough to look after him when he is disabled?' and by saying this she was not giving them any choice. In cases like these we often end up operating because it's easier than being honest and it means that we can avoid a painful conversation. You might think the operation has been a success because the patient leaves the hospital alive but if you saw them years later - as i often do - you would realize that the result of the operation was a human disaster.

'My wife's a psychiatrist, you know,' he said. 'When she was training she worked in a brain damaged unit for a while. I'm with you on this one - so many of the head injuries have terrible lives. If neurosurgeons followed up the severe head injuries they treated I'm sure they'd be more discriminating in whom they operated upon.'

I left them in the little room, their knees squeezed together as the four of them sat on the small sofa and wondered, yet again, as I walked down the dark hospital corridor, at the way we cling so tightly to life and how there would be so much less suffering if we did not. Life without hope is hopelessly difficult but that the end hope can so easily make such fools of us all.

And now all those brain cells are dead - and my mother - who in a sense was the complex electrochemical interaction of all these millions of neurons - is no more. In neuroscience it is called 'the binding problem' - the extraordinary fact, which nobody can even begin to explain, that mere brute matter can give rise to consciousness and sensation.

Neuroscience tells us that it is highly improbable that we have souls, as everything we think and feel is no more or no less that the electrochemical chatter of our nerve cells. Our sense of self, our feelings and our thoughts, our love for others, our hopes and ambitions, our hates and fears all die when our brains die. Many people deeply resent this view of things, which not only deprives us of life after death but also seems to downgrade thought to mere electrochemistry and reduces us to mere automata, to machines. Such people are profoundly mistaken, since what it really does is upgrade matter into something infinitely mysterious that we do not understand.

It is sad how easy it is to dismiss people with damaged or disfigured faces, to forget that the feelings behind their mask-like faces are no less intense than our own.

You might expect that seeing so much pain and suffering might help you keep your own difficulties in perspective but, alas, it does not.
