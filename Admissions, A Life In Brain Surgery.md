Attempted suicides are often viewed by hospital staff with scorn and condescension - as failures in both living and dying, and as the agents of their own misfortune.

  

It is impossible to know how my life would have developed without so much help and kindness from others.

  

'No, no, no! What's she do for a living?' I ask. I have noticed they never describe a patient's occupation, which is supposed to be a normal part of presenting a patient's history \[...\] mentioning a patient's occupation is important: not so much for the traditional reason, which is to alert us to possible occupational diseases, but more to remind us that the patient is a person, an individual, has a life and a story beyond being a mere anonymous patient with a disease

  

As a visiting doctor from the West it is hard, at first, to understand the difficulties our colleagues face working in countries with very different cultures and without the rules of law. It is easy to feel superior, to pass condescending judgement. I hope that over the years I have learnt to observe, and no longer to judge. I want to be useful, not to criticize. Besides, so often I find that I have misunderstood or misinterpreted what I have seen or been told - I have learnt not to trust myself. All knowledge is provisional.

  

We operate in the hope that patients will make a good recovery, but the triumphs wouldn't be triumphant if there weren't disasters. If the operations never went wrong, there would be nothing very special about them.

  

There has always been a tension at the heart of medicine, between caring for patients and making money. It involves, of course, a bit of both, but it's a delicate balance and very easily upset. High pay and high professional standards are essential if this balance is to be maintained. The rule of law, after all, in part depends on paying judges so well that they will not be tempted to accept bribes.

  

\[Talking about traffic in Kathmandu\] Everybody is resigned to the grotesque struggle which they have no power to end.

  

The dualism of seeing mind and matter as separate entities is deeply ingrained in us, as is the belief in an immaterial soul which will somehow outlive our bodies and brains. My 'I', my conscious self, writing these words, does not feel like electrochemistry, but that is what it is.

  

It is estimated that there are 7,000 people in the UK in a 'persistent vegetative or minimally conscious state'. They are hidden from view in long-term institutions or cared for at home, twenty-four hours a day, by their families. There is a great underworld of suffering away from which most of us turn our faces.

  

Popper taught me to distrust unquestioned authority, and that our moral duty in life is to reduce suffering by 'piecemeal social engineering' and not with grand schemes driven by ideology.

  

Money and medicine have always gone together: would could be more precious than health?

  

It is very easy to underestimate the importance of endless practice with practical skills. You learn them by doing, much more than by knowing. It becomes what psychologists call implicit memory. When we learn a new skill the brain has to work hard - is is a consciously directed process requiring frequent repetition and the expenditure of energy. But once it is learnt, the skill - the motor and sensory coordination muscles of the brain - becomes unconscious, fast and efficient. Only a small area of the brain is activated when the skill is exercised, although at the sam time it has been shown, for instance, that professional pianists' brains develop larger hand areas than the brains of amateur pianists. To learn is to restructure your brain. It is a simple truth \[...\]

  

When i see the tidy simplicity of the lives of the people living in the boats moored along the canal by the lock-keeper's cottage, of the sparse homes of the Nepalese peasants William and I walked past on our trek, I cannot help but think about the vast amount of clutter and possessions in my life. \[...\] I regret that I did not recognize the virtues of trying to travel with hand luggage only at an earlier stage of my life. There are no pockets in the shroud.

  

A doctor's duty is to relieve suffering as well as prolong life

  

When my brain dies, 'I' will die. 'I' am a transient electrochemical dance, made of myriad bits of information; and information, as the physicists tell us, is physical. What those myriad pieces of information, disassembled, will re-combine to form after my death, there is no way of knowing.

  

it is only after we wake that the conscious brain, seeking meaning, quickly stitches together a whole cloth out of haphazard scraps
