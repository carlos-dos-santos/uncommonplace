The calculations of life expectancy given at birth are slowly becoming more accurate and we know that among the next two generations, those of my children and grandchildren, there will be more centenarians than have ever before existed in human history. Yet the maximum age to which our species is capable of living is not increasing. What is changing dramatically is the average age at which we die, and therefore we are seeing an increase in the number of individuals falling into the far-right regions of the bell curve. In other words, we are changing the shape of human demography. The rapidly expanding health and social issues created by the growth of an ageing population are starting to give us a glimpse of the resulting impact on society.

What makes us human? One of my favourite definitions is: “Humans belong to the group of conscious beings that are carbon-based, solar-system dependent, limited in knowledge, prone to error and mortal”.

I realised that day that when the animation of the person we were is stripped out of the vessel we used to pilot our way through life, it leaves little more than an echo or shadow in the physical world.

I did it willingly, though with a heavy heart, and proudly, as the last service a grateful daughter could perform in this life for a genuinely kind and loving mother.

People don’t have to be alive to make their presence felt.

I don’t need my death to be prevented.
