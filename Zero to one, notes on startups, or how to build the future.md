brilliant thinking is rare, but courage is in even shorter supply than genius

  

startups operate on the principle that you need to work with other people to get stuff done, but you also need to stay small enough so that you actually can

  

as a good rule of thumb, proprietary technology must be at least 10 times better than its closest substitute in some important dimension to lead to a real market monopolistic advantage. anything less than an order of magnitude better will probably be perceived as a marginal improvement and will be hard to sell, especially in an already crowded market

  

the actual truth is that there are many more secrets left to find, but they will yield only to relentless searches. there is more to do in science, medicine, engineering, and in technology of all kinds. we are within reach not just of marginal goals set at the competitive edge of today's conventional disciplines, but of ambitions, so great that even the boldest minds of the scientific revolution hesitated to announce them directly. we could cure cancer, dementia, and all the diseases of age and metabolic decay. we can find new ways to generate energy that free the world from conflict over fossil fuels. we can invent faster ways to travel from place to place over the surface of the planet; we can even learn how to escape it entirely and settle new frontiers. but we will never learn any of these secrets unless we demand to know them and force ourselves to look. 

  

if you've invented new but you haven't invented an effective way to sell it, you have a bad business - no matter how good the product.

  

men and machines are good at fundamentally different things

  

once computers can answer all our questions, perhaps they'll ask why they should remain subservient to us at all
