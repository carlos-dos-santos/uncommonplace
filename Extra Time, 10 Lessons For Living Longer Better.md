Living longer is not a blessing, in my view, unless it is living better for longer. 
#older-adults #wellness

Neither of my parents had any desire to live to 100. What they cared about was living as full a life as possible, and then hopefully checking out as fast as possible. 
#life-and-death 

My chief interest is in improving life, not prolonging it. 

Three of the tenets of the old-age gurus: keep active, retain your sense of purpose and connect with people.

65 is now the age at which many institutions impose a concept of old age upon their citizens \[...\] ‘65+’ is often the maximum age bracket cited in questionnaires, with no other boxes to tick - as if it’s the beginning of the end. 
#data

The insight that chronological age is a poor way to classify who is “old” came originally from the Canadian-American demographer Norman Ryder, who realised in the 1970s that expected lifespan is a better indicator than age of our needs for state support: which is, after all, what the state is interested in. 
#ageing 

Negativity is rife. Broadcasters, galleries and museums spend hours worrying about how to reach more youthful audiences - despite the fact that older people have more time and money, and are growing in number. We value youth, tech and energy over wisdom and maturity, or so it seems. 
#wisdom

Longevity is bringing some people more years of good health, but others more years of frailty.
#frailty

Narrowing that gap, providing people with more equal life chances, must surely be one of the most important social justice missions of our times. The rich and well educated already know some of the secrets of making the most of Extra Time \[...\] but unless we spread that knowledge to everyone, we will all be the poorer. 
#justice

Extra Time has given us an entirely new stage of life: the stage of the ‘Young-Old’. We need to catch up to this new reality, stop lumping everyone from 60-100 together, and accept that it is normal to be vibrant and capable in your seventies.

In 2017, \[Sir Muir Gray\] and colleagues calculated that the UK could save several billions a year from ‘even modest improvements in fitness’ to stop older people crossing the line from independence to dependence: needing carers or going into a home. 
#care

The fitness gap can be narrowed, Gray argues, from any age. Even 90-year-olds can improve their strength with relatively small amounts of exercise. Three months of balance and gait training, and mild weight-bearing exercises, can reduce falls - which are responsible for 5 times as many hospitalisations among the over-65s as any other injury. \[...\] In the UK, 10 percent of ambulances are called out for older people who have fallen over. 
#falls

If we were serious about keeping people from crossing the line to dependence, we would put huge effort not only into preventing falls, but also delaying the onset of dementia. \[...\] If we could delay onset by only 5 years, we would reduce the number of cases by a third.

“There is nothing pre-determined about ageing, so there’s no ageing gene, it’s a matter of what biologists refer to as the environment, which is everything else. This means we don’t have to sit on the sidelines and just watch people age, we can give them advice about what a healthy outcome in later life will consist of, and how to ensure that if they do reach 100, their bodies and minds are in the best possible shape.” Alan Walker

Public health is the Cinderella of government policy, the bit which gets cut when funding is tight. 
#healthcare #money

Extra Time will be a Pyrrhic victory if we are doomed to spend years too weak to get out of a chair. Luckily, many of the keys to living longer better are within our control. We should be running exercise programs for people of all ages to “close the fitness gap”. We should tackle junk food as aggressively as we once tackled cigarettes. We should teach children about the revolutionary change in their life expectancy and what they can do to ensure a healthy and happy later life. But most of all, we need to stop confusing “ageing” with loss of fitness. And be far more positive about what life can be. 
#pyrric-victory 

If 50 is the cliff edge, what about giving people a Mid-Career MOT, to help them take stock of where they are in their lives? We get careers advice at 16, when we haven’t got a clue, so why not advise people who have already experienced the workplace and know what they’re good at? A Mid-Career MOT could be a positive way to think about Extra Time: assess skills, health and finances, while emphasising the fact that most 50-year-olds are still mid-career, not slowing down.

Tharman’s insight is that learning should be a continuous process which binds all the age groups together, not just a silo for young or old. It’s never too early to start - his government is also heavily subsidising weaker learners in pre-school - nor is it ever too late to stop. 
#learning #education 

“RIP the three stage working life” \[Scott & Gratton\] - the old model of “education-work-leisure” no longer fits when people are living so much longer. All countries need their own version of SkillsFuture: one in which age is irrelevant, and what matters is interest and aptitude. 
#curiosity 

People who do caring jobs are often looked down on, or described as ‘unskilled’, because they have talents which are not ‘academic’. 

The discovery that our brains keep changing and developing throughout our lives is revolutionary. It should profoundly alter our attitude to ageing. 
#neuroplasticity #the-brain 

Harvard Medical School has developed a six-step programme for cognitive health. The tenets are: eat a plant-based diet, exercise regularly, manage stress, nurture social contacts and keep challenging your brain. 
#cognition

To function well in later life, memory may be less important than being able to multi-task and spot patterns.
#memory #patterns

The most successful learners use judgements of probability, not memory. 
#decision-making 

The 2017 Lancet Commission on Dementia found that ‘physical exercise and intellectual stimulation over the lifespan is associated with reduced risk of dementia in later life, even among individuals with a genetic predisposition to dementia.’ Yet few adults are even aware that it’s possible to reduce the risk of dementia, compared with over three quarters who recognise that we can reduce our risk of heart disease. 

The ‘Young-Old’ do not want a quiet life, they want to live like they mean it. The ‘Old-Old’ do not wish to be warehoused and bossed around, they want to remain the authors of their own lives. \[...\] What everyone needs is a neighbourhood, preferably designed with their input. 
#meaningfulness #autonomy 

There are literally millions of older people in European cities who rarely or never leave their homes for social, emotional, financial or mobility reasons. It’s no good having a ‘kneeling’ bus if you can’t get to the bus stop - or you’re scared to walk down the street because it’s unsafe.

Health Revolution: Robots care for you, humans care about you.

Arguably, we should be aiming to have as many geriatricians as paediatricians. Elder care has traditionally lacked glamour. After all, who wants to manage decline? But the best geriatricians achieve wonders by administering hope, not pessimism, and seeing the patient as a whole person, not a problematic knee or hip. Those are the people we need to help us shift healthcare towards staying healthy, not just treating illness. 
#medicine   

A 2018 review by the US academic Eric Topol found that nine in ten jobs in the NHS will require some element of digital skills within 20 years. But as long as we don’t delegate everything to robots, technology offers the chance to take more responsibility for our own health, streamline bureaucratic systems and relieve some of the burden on professionals. We are still going to need compassionate carers and we need to value them too.

Maybe we miss a trick when we invent tea parties to bring older people together. People can be desperately lonely, yet still be reluctant to be shoe-horned into events with others with whom they have nothing in common, except age. Rather than aimless coffee mornings, perhaps we need tea parties with a purpose. 
#purpose

The word ‘volunteering’ can sound a bit weak. People often think of dutiful ladies working behind the counter in charity shops, or arranging flowers in a church. While there’s nothing wrong with either of those, it is less well understood that dedicated volunteers can also make a real, measurable difference to public services. Since a HelpForce volunteer started calling people to remind them to go to their appointments at the memory clinic, attendance has leapt from 15% to 100%. Others are driving patients to appointments, sitting with them through the consultations and taking notes, then dropping them home, sometimes picking up a pint of milk on the way. This is comforting, practical help for people who live alone, and a cost-saver for hospitals \[...\] whose annual bill for transporting patients home runs into the millions of pounds. 
#volunteering #generosity   

As we grow older, we become more focussed on meaningful experiences and close relationships. That may fill a deep need. George Vaillant \[...\] found that people in their seventies who mentored or supported others were three times happier, and had stronger marriages, than those who didn’t.

Few will thrive on 30 years of leisure. Some people are burned out; others have caring responsibilities. But we have to wean ourselves off this idea of the “Golden Years” of leisure and regain our idealism about what older people can offer, at a time when there are so many societal problems to fix. 
#leisure

\[on re-writing the social contract\] The obvious starting point is to challenge the institutional concept that old age starts at 65 and the practice - in many Western countries - of retiring even earlier \[...\] this no longer makes sense when life expectancy has risen so much. 
#social-contract 

We need to be much more ambitious for ourselves, and for our health systems, which must change from factories which were built to heal the sick, and send them on their way, into networks which help people stay independent and healthy as long as possible.
