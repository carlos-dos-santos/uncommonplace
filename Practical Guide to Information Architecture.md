 However, it isn’t just grouping items that make supermarkets and websites work well. It’s about creating groups that make sense to the people who use them.

That’s what information architecture is all about:
1\. Organising content or objects  
2\. Describing them clearly  
3\. Providing ways for people to get to them.

The information architecture (how things are grouped and labelled) directly affects how easy things are to use.

Good information architecture can do more than just help people find objects and information. It can empower people by making it easier for them to learn and make better decisions.

You need to understand three very important things before you can design an IA that works really well:

People: What they need do to, how they think and what they already know
Content: What you have, what you should have and what you need  
Context: The business or personal goals for the site, who else will be involved and what your constraints are.

The most important thing for graphic designers to remember is that the IA should be designed before the navigation so the navigation suits the IA, not the other way around.

 

One of the most important aspects of a good IA is that it works well for the people who need to use it.  The person creating the IA must genuinely care about understanding the people who will use the site, and be willing to represent their needs (and go in to bat for them when the pressure is on).

A good IA works well for both the users and the content, and also meets the goals of the business.
