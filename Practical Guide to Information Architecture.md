 However, it isn’t just grouping items that make supermarkets and websites work well. It’s about creating groups that make sense to the people who use them.

That’s what information architecture is all about:
1\. Organising content or objects  
2\. Describing them clearly  
3\. Providing ways for people to get to them.

The information architecture (how things are grouped and labelled) directly affects how easy things are to use.

Good information architecture can do more than just help people find objects and information. It can empower people by making it easier for them to learn and make better decisions.

You need to understand three very important things before you can design an IA that works really well:
People: What they need do to, how they think and what they already know
Content: What you have, what you should have and what you need  
Context: The business or personal goals for the site, who else will be involved and what your constraints are.

The most important thing for graphic designers to remember is that the IA should be designed before the navigation so the navigation suits the IA, not the other way around.

One of the most important aspects of a good IA is that it works well for the people who need to use it.  The person creating the IA must genuinely care about understanding the people who will use the site, and be willing to represent their needs (and go in to bat for them when the pressure is on).

A good IA works well for both the users and the content, and also meets the goals of the business.

Pain points are a good starting point for a discussion, as they give everyone something concrete to discuss.

“What’s the one piece of information on the intranet you couldn’t live without?” or “What would cause you a lot of trouble if we took it away?”

Goals: What are the aims or goals of doing this work? 
Technology: What are the technology opportunities and constraints?
Design: Are there design constraints you need to consider?
Culture: What sort of culture are you working within, and how will that affect your project?
Stakeholders: Who is, and who should be, involved in the project? 
Scope: How will we know when it's "finished"? How will we measure it or measure the impact of any changes?

Everyone starts with some level of knowledge about a topic. But you may want to know what they feel is missing, or how good the quality of the existing information is. [...] People think at different levels depending on their experience. 

There isn’t a soul out there who will only search or only browse. Oh, people definitely have preferences. [...] The decision to search or browse has much more to do with the information task people are trying to perform.

A lot of websites I’ve worked with in the past few years contain fantastic, detailed content. But they forget to provide high-level overviews. People get very frustrated when they want just the main ideas, a summary or the big picture, but have to dig around in detailed content first. The solution is simple: make sure you provide summaries of detailed content.

The most important thing to know about categories is they don’t exist independently in the world. They exist in the human brain. They’re formed over time, based on our experiences with the world. And because we all think differently, we all have different ideas about categories.

There is no right way to categorise a particular set of information. In most situations there’s more than one way to categorise a given set of information, and the ‘right’ answer will depend on things such as:
- what people already know about the information 
- what they will be using information for
- how they think

When we’re researching and looking for information, we mainly think about the topic we’re interested in.

it’s almost always better to arrange content around topics than around tasks or audiences, given this is where people think.

This happens a lot when I talk to subject matter experts. They think at a more precise, more detailed level. Sometimes the people who will use their information will be thinking at a much broader level. Your IA job is to bridge the gap between the two – not always an easy task. But armed with a better understanding of why it happens, you’ll be better prepared for it.

A content audit is most useful for product sites. You may not need to list out every item sold on the website, but you still need information on a good cross-section.

One of the most important aspects of an inventory is the relationship between items.

For many years a web myth stated that everything should be fewer than three clicks from the home page. [...] For many sites, this is just impractical. To fit everything into a hierarchy like that, there would be so many items at each level it would be impossible to select.

Instead, it’s far more important that people can make easy choices at each level, and know they’re on the correct or comfortable path. People really will keep clicking if they feel like they are on the right track and learning as they go.

In a lot of situations (again, mainly for large sites) you’ll learn it won’t be possible to ‘organise’ the content in a single way that will suit all the users – usually because they have different information needs and different levels of experience with the topic.

In this situation, I’ve used a ‘focused entry points’ pattern. When I use this pattern, I set up the site using whichever pattern best suits the content and the people who need it (usually a hierarchy).

Then, acknowledging that some people simply won’t be able to find information using the main structure, I provide a series of ‘entry points’ that help other users find their way. These entry points don’t have to cover the whole site content – you may use them to provide easy access to just key information.

Words. In all IA work, everything comes down to the words. No matter how well you group content together or how easy it is to see on a page, the success comes down to what you call things. Words will make your IA a success, or have people staring stupidly at the page wondering what to click on.

If there is a big gap between correct terminology and the terms your audience uses, think about how you may deal with this on screen. For example, you may decide to include descriptions as well as labels, or provide different ways to get to the same content.
