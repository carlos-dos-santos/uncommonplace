the best defence against disappointment expectation is

“why, katin? go on, you tell me. why did they do that to us.” no question mark ended his sentence. hoarse outrage hung there instead. 

“because people are stupid, and narrow, and afraid of anything different.”

“note to myself number twelve thousand eight hundred and ten: intelligence creates alienation and unhappiness in…” he stopped the recorder. Blinking, he looked after the twins. 

“nets,” satin mused. he leaned forward on the rail. “a great net, spreading among the stars, through time-“ he spoke slowly, softly.

katin shook the nets again. “from star to star, Mouse, imagine, a great web that spread across the galaxy, as far as man. that’s the matrix in which history happens today. don’t you see? that’s it? that’s my theory. each individual is a junction in that net, and the strands between are the cultural, economic, the psychological threads that hold individual to individual. any historic event is like a ripple in the net\[…\] it passes over and through the web, stretching or shrinking those cultural bonds that involve each man with each man. if the event is catastrophic enough, the bonds break. the net is torn awhile.”

nine times out of ten, when i say hello to someone in passing, or when the person i speak to is going off to do something else, i spend the next fifteen minutes or so rehearsing the incident, wondering whether my smile was taken for undue familiarity, or my sober expression improperly construed as coldness. i repeat the exchange to myself a dozen times, varying my tone of voice and trying to extrapolate the change this might cause in the other person’s reaction”

You know the curve of your hand in the hand of someone more important to you than anybody? That's the spirals of the galaxy locked in one another. You know the curve of your hand when the other hand is gone and you're trying to remember how it felt? There is no other curve like that. I want to play them against each other. Katin says I'm scared. I am, Captain. Of everything around me. So whatever I see, I press against my eyeballs, stick my fingers and tongue in it. I live today; that means I have to live scared. Because today is scary. And at least I'm not afraid of being frightened.
