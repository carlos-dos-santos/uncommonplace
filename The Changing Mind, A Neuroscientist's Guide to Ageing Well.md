Genetics is not an edict - the traits that our genes contribute to still need to navigate the twisty and unpredictable roads of culture and opportunity. \[...\] The way the brain wires itself up, both in the womb and throughout the lifespan, is a complex tango between genetic possibilities and environmental factors.
#the-brain 

Where certain faculties have slowed, \[the elderly\] find that extra-ordinary compensatory mechanisms have kicked in - positive changes in mood and outlook, punctuated by the exceptional benefits of experience. Yes, older minds might process information more slowly than younger ones, but they can intuitively synthesize a lifetime of information and make smarter decisions based on decades of learning from their mistakes. Among the many advantages of being old, they are less fearful of calamities because they’re been dealt a few in the past and managed to work through them.

Perhaps the most important traits to foster and develop throughout the life span are those in Factor III, Conscientiousness. Conscientious people are more likely to have a doctor and to go see one when they’re sick. They’re more likely to get regular medical checkups and to reliably keep up with their professional, family and financial commitments. This may sound like a mostly practical matter, but Factor III traits are highly correlated with a panoply of positive life outcomes. Conscientiousness has been linked to lower all-cause mortality. \[...\] To become more conscientious, one must change underlying cognitive processes such as self-regulation (controlling impulsive behaviours) and self-monitoring (noticing which circumstances lead to successful self-regulation and which circumstances sabotage self-regulation. If you wish you had more of these, a number of different methods have been shown to work for adults of any age, from cognitive behavioural therapy to David Allen’s book Getting Things Done. #conscientiousness #self-awareness 

Charles Koch: “I'd rather hire someone who is conscientious, curious, and honest than someone who is highly intelligent but lacks those qualities. Runaway intelligence without conscientiousness, curiosity and honesty, I learned, can lead to dismal outcomes.”

A famous old psychology experiment shows that people who act as if they’re happy end up being happy.

From a neurocognitive standpoint, wisdom is the ability to see patterns where others don’t see them, to extract generalized common points from prior experience and use those to make predictions about what is likely to happen next. 
#wisdom

If you work out the math, you’ll find that by adulthood, there will be more connections in the human brain - more possible thoughts and brain states, that is - than there are particles in the known universe. This may be one of the reasons we can have so much trouble predicting one another’s behaviour.

I want to join John Zeisel, founder of the I’m Still Here Foundation, and say that the biggest challenge faced by dementia is the public narrative of despair, that nothing can be done about it. I do not believe that this is true. I believe we should replace the stigmatization of dementia with hope, and the recognition that people with dementia are still there. The Lancet’s expert panel provides some hope. As they state, “Dementia is by no means an inevitable consequence of reaching retirement age, or even of entering the ninth decade. There are lifestyle factors that may reduce, or increase, an individual’s risk of developing dementia. In some populations dementia is already being delayed for years… One third of dementia cases may be preventable.”
#dementia 

Asked to categorize faces as threatening or benign, you’ll expand your definition of threatening if the proportion of threatening faces decreases below a certain level. The same is true with more abstract judgements, such as judging whether a certain behaviour is ethical: in the absence of clearly unethical behaviours, behaviours that were seen as acceptable before now loom as un-ethical. This has large societal implications. 
#ethics 

\[on cataracts\] Remember that evolution is dependent on reproduction to transmit survival advantages across multiple generations. Consequently, evolution does not generate adaptive improvements for conditions that occur outside of normal reproductive age. Hence. There has been no evolutionary pressure to favor people who don’t get cataracts or presbyopia, and so they are ever-present in ageing populations. 

\[similarly, on why processing speed slows\] A biological explanation is that there is no evolutionary pressure for the prefrontal cortex to stay sharp \[...\] once we are past the age of reproducing and passing our genes to the next generation. \[...\] And so processing  speed, led by prefrontal cortex decline, slows down. 
#evolution

\[on disgust\] Because our reactions to certain smells or tastes are so immediate and so visceral, it’s tempting to think that there is some molecule or quality in the object that IS disgusting, but this would be wrong - the brain has to interpret it as disgusting, and not all brains react the same way. 
#perception 

The wisdom that we find in older adults - the most experienced members of our population - follows from these four specific things: associations, experience, pattern recognition, and the use of analogies. And this is why we gain more and more wisdom as we age. Wisdom comes from the accumulated set of things we’ve seen and experienced, our ability to detect patterns in those experiences, and our ability to predict future outcomes based on them. (And what is intelligence if not that?)
#intelligence

A young, strong person might be able to carry a heavy load up a hill without breaking a sweat. An older person will think to put it on a handcart or dolly. 

Believing you can’t change your life ends up being a self-fulfilling prophecy because you bypass opportunities that COULD help you change your life. There is an irony here, in that believing you can change your life isn’t the same as being able to predict or plan how your life will go. As Linda Ronstadt said, “People always think careers are based on calculated decision-making, that your career is the outcome of how you think it’s going to look… The process is so different than that.”
#intent

Immersing yourself fully in whatever activities you engage in - work, leisure, family, community - is protective against cognitive decline and physical illness. The rewards from doing the things that please you lift your mood, and strengthen the immune system, increasing the production of cytokines, T-cells, and immunoglobulin A.
#committment 

Think about nursing and retirement homes, what we used to call “old age homes”. In many cases, the staff do everything that residents formerly did for themselves, such as cooking and cleaning. Setting aside those individuals who can’t do things for themselves, because of mobility problems or dementia, a number of individuals who could be doing things are encouraged not to, encouraged to “relax and take it easy”. The message that many older adults hear from this is “You are not capable, you no longer matter.” The debilitated condition of many older adults in these facilities may result, at least in part, from being encouraged to live in a decision-free environment. Is this condition reversible? 
#care

A landmark study in the 1970s explored choice and responsibility in a nursing home. Half of the residents were given a potted plant and told that the nursing staff would water and take care of it. The other half were first given a choice of whether they wanted a plant or not and, if they said yes, were told it was their responsibility to take care of it. This simple, almost trivial-sounding intervention had dramatic consequences. The residents who had even this small amount of choice and responsibility, for a houseplant, were happier and more active. They spent more time visiting with others and talking to staff. They were significantly more alert. 
#choice #responsibility #autonomy 

Research shows that, as we age, our friends and family play a critical role in this unfolding story. If the people around us support and encourage our autonomy, we will tend to do better. If we are surrounded by people who discourage our autonomy and try to convince us that we shouldn’t be doing things we’ve always done, our lives can quickly go off the rails. 
#relationships 

Navigating the complex mores and potential pitfalls of dealing with another human being, someone who has their own needs, opinions, and sensitivities, is about the most complex thing that we humans can do. It exercises vast neural networks, keeping them tuned up, in shape, and ready to fire. In good conversation, we listen, we empathise. And empathy is healthful, activating networks throughout the brain, including the posterior parietal cortex and inferior frontal gyrus.

\[on compulsory retirement\] Imagine what it must be like to live a long and rich life, to feel valued and contribute to society, and then suddenly be taken out of the loop. 

Pain is a formidable opponent and even the spectacular advances made in medical science are no match for it. We tend to think of medical science in terms of how much it can prolong life, and as a society, we pour a great deal of money and other resources into trying to cure diseases that shorten life span - such as cancer. But we haven’t solved the problem of how to eradicate pain. In other words, medical science tends to focus on life span rather than disease span. 
#pain

Cancer (at 16%) is a major cause of death, but in terms of disability it is a tiny 3%, compared to, say, falls, which account for 7% of disability. It isn’t that we shouldn’t be trying to cure cancer and heart disease, but that an outsized amount of money gets spent on life span research compared to what is spent on health span research. \[...\] Pain research revieces just a tiny sliver of the funding devoted to medical research, perhaps because of the widely-held belief that “pain hurts, but it doesn’t kill you.” But in fact, it can. Chronic pain creates a 1.57 increased mortality risk. 
#falls

What about gut-wrenching psychological suffering, such as you experience when your boyfriend or girlfriend leaves you - is that a kind of physical pain? We talk of a broken heart as pain, metaphorically. Yet mental anguish is related to pain. Grief, for example, can be felt quite physically, and stress or sadness can lead to migraines, fatigue, gastric upset, and so on. Because all pain is ultimately brain-based, there is no scientific reason to separate mental, emotional pain from physical pain. hbj
#suffering 

Ageing is an irreversible and inescapable process. But the effects of ageing are, in some cases, reversible and, it not completely escapable, at least subject to delay. There are many factors under our control - diet, gut microbiota, social networks, sleep, regular visits to the doctor. But the single most important correlate of vibrant mental and physical health is physical activity. This doesn’t mean the other correlates (diet and sleep) aren’t important - they are - and it doesn’t mean that if you engage in more physical activity you don’t need to follow other healthy practices. What it does mean is that you might want to take this seriously - particularly if, like many people, your attitude about getting active is “Yeah, yeah - I’ll start tomorrow.” As Scott Grafton points out, physical activity is not the same as exercise. It’s moving around, interacting with the environment. As Cicero knew, it is this kind of interaction that “supports the spirits, and keeps the mind in vigour.” Running has benefits, but so does walking, even with a cane or walker. 
#sleep

When scientists talk about ageing we’re not talking about chronological age, because there is a wide variety of ways that people age. What we’re really interested in is the accumulated effect of things that happen to our bodies that cause difficulties. Neuroscientists use the word “senescence” - just a fancy Latin-rooted word that means to grow old or age. You can’t turn back the clock on your chronological age, but you can decrease the likelihood of senescence by adopting simple principles. 
#erganomics 

\[like Kahneman’s pain research findings\] A happy life that ended abruptly was considered more desirable than a happy one with five extra years tacked on at the end that were merely pleasant but not as happy as before. In contrast, a terrible life was considered more desirable if it was longer, provided the last five years - although still unpleasant - weren’t as terrible as life had been before. 
#relativity 

The things people die from (heart disease, cancer) tend not to be the things that impact quality of life (disability, pain, hearing loss, vision loss). Add to this the fact that the medical profession tends to focus on saving lives and cures, with relatively less attention paid to the sequelae of disease - the “What next?” question. 
#life-and-death 

We can change the conversation, throughout society, about what it means to be an older adult. We often look at old age as a time of limitations, infirmities, and sadness. 

\[on social comparison theory\] We are a social species, and we are attuned to fairness.

A bigger predictor than cholesterol level at age fifty for health at age eighty is the quality of your relationships. Good relationships protect your brain.

\[on retirement\] Most important, I think we need to work together to fight for changes in the way our societies see older adults, particularly how they see them in the workforce. 
#retirement

\[on volunteering if working isn’t possible\] There are still many ways to stay actively engaged in meaningful work. \[...\] In one study, volunteers felt a greater sense of accomplishment than a group of control participants and had increases in brain volume for the hippocampus and context, compared to the controls, who had brain volume reductions. This was particularly true of male volunteers, who showed a reversal of three years of ageing over two years of volunteering. As Anaïs Nin observed, “Life shrinks or expands in proportion to one’s courage.” It’s true of brain volume as well.

\[on having a steady doctor\] Dr Eduardo Dolhun: Context matters. If the environment can modify gene expression-epigenetics, then it stands to reason that the context within which a person lives is not only important, but critical to understand. The patient-doctor dyad is a dialectic that grows over time, and allows the doctor to more fully appreciate the subtle nuances of behaviour and physiology that can signal disease or lack of health.
  

A movement is building to provide more customised care from family doctors, through what is called a patient-centred medical home. The concept is to provide:

-   a single centralised source of medical care and medical records;
    

-   A patient-centred approach that emphasises the whole person; and
    
-   A team of caregivers in addition to the physician, including a nursing team, physician assistants, and office staff, who all contribute to continuity of care.

One of the greatest difficulties people with Alzheimer’s and mild cognitive impairment have is getting used to something new. Start planning now so that new systems seem familiar.

  

\[Importance of Advance Medical Directives +++ but “Standard advance directive are often not helpful for patients who develop dementia” so they need their own, special one, which is goal oriented - “if I have \[mild/moderate/severe\] dementia, I would want the goal for my care to be:”\]


Like any part of life itself, the end of life is less stressful and potentially more peaceful if we take the time to learn about it. 


In the end, in the battle to hang onto life, nature always wins.

The single most important factor in determining successful ageing is the personality trait of conscientiousness. Conscientiousness is associated with a great number of positive outcomes in life. As I wrote in the first chapter, the fields of psychiatry and clinical psychology are predicated on the premise that you can change; you can will yourself or train yourself to be more conscientious, and the benefits will still accrue to you. 
#conscientiousness 

We need to change the way our society thinks about the aged. A relationship of mutual respect between older and younger people is one of the greatest enhancers of anyone’s quality of life. I began this book with a question for us to ask ourselves, one that gets to the heart of how we see the future of ageing. What would it mean for all of us to think of the elderly as resource rather than burden and of ageing as a culmination rather than denouement? 

We need to educate ourselves and our families about the advantages of ageing - the wisdom, the bias toward positivity, the compassion that older adults exhibit. As individuals, as community members, as a society, it is in all of our best interests to help construct a culture that embraces the gifts of the elderly, weaving cross-generational interactions into the fabric of everyday experience. By learning from the science of the brain we can create a transformative understanding of the ageing process, its human story, and in the process create a richer quality of life.
