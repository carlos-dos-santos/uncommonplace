# uncommonplace

This is where I store exerpts and quotes from things I read. It's a [commonplace book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonplace_book) aiming for cross-pollination in as many ways as possible. 

I used to store everything first (many years ago) in a paper book, then in a Word file, then a Google Docs file, and now using [obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/). 

The local file gets updated roughly weekly, when I finish a book.
