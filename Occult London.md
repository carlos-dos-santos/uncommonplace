But when we talk of the occult, what exactly do we mean? Definitions seem to be as nebulous as the supernatural phenomena they claim to describe. The only point of unity appears to be an academic dismissiveness towards the occult itself and an uneasy mistrust of its practitioners \[...\] for ultimately, the occult may be regarded as much more than a footnote to the official version. Instead it comes to symbolise those neglected quarters of the city and their forgotten histories, which continue to resist all attempts to overwrite or erase them, and whose peculiarity provides a welcome corrective to the more anodyne aspects of London’s carefully managed past.
