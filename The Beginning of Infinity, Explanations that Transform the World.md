**Although our night sky appears serene and largely changeless, the universe is seething with violent activity. Even a typical star converts millions of tonnes of mass into energy every second, with each gram releasing as much energy as an atom bomb. 

  

The quest for authority led empiricists to downplay and stigmatise conjecture, the real source of all our theories. \[aka “Conjecture: the origin of all knowledge” and “The real source of our theories is conjecture, and the real source of our knowledge is conjecture alternating with criticism. We create theories by rearranging, combining, altering and adding to existing ideas with the intention of improving upon them. The role of experimentation and observation is to choose between existing theories, not to be the source of new ones.”\]

  

But the one thing that all conceptions of the Enlightenment agree on is that it was a rebellion, and specifically a rebellion against authority in regard to knowledge. 

  

This is why the Royal Society (one of the earliest scientific academies, founded in London in 1660) took as its motto “Nullius in verba”, which means something like “Take no one’s word for it.” 

  

However, rebellion against authority cannot by itself be what made the difference. Authorities have been rejected many times in history, and only rarely has any lasting good come of it. The usual sequel is that new authorities replaced the old. What was needed for the sustained, rapid growth of knowledge was a tradition of criticism. Before the Enlightenment, that was a very rare sort of tradition: usually the whole point of a tradition was to keep things the same. 

  

Very little in nature is detectable by unaided human senses. Most of what happens is too fast or too slow, too big or too small, or too remote, or hidden behind opaque barriers, or operates on principles too different from anything that influenced our evolution. But in some cases we can arrange for such phenomena to become perceptible, via scientific instruments. 

  

Edison said that research is one per cent inspiration and ninety-nine per cent perspiration - but that is misleading, because people can apply creativity even to tasks that computers and other machines do uncreatively. So science is not mindless toil for which rare moments of discovery are the compensation: the toil can be creative, and fun, just as the discovery of new explanations is. 

  

Most ancient accounts of reality beyond our everyday experience were not only false, they had a radically different character from modern ones: they were anthropocentric. 

So fruitful has this abandonment of anthropocentric theories been, and so important in the broader history of ideas, that anti-anthropocentrism has increasingly been elevated to the status of a universal principle, sometimes called the Principle of Mediocrity: there is nothing significant about humans (in the cosmic scheme of things). As Stephen Hawking put it, humans are ‘just a chemical scum on the surface of a typical planet that’s in orbit round a typical star on the outskirts of a typical galaxy.’

  

Everything that is not forbidden by laws of nature is achievable, given the right knowledge. 

  

In the unique case of humans, the difference between a hospitable environment and a death-trap depends on what knowledge they have created. 

  

It is inevitable that we face problems, but no particular problem is inevitable. We survive, and thrive, by solving each particular problem as it comes up.
