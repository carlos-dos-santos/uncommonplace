It’s amazing what a wife can do if she knows her own mind, or minds in your case, course. Look at King Verence the First, for one. He used to toss all his meat bones over his shoulder until he was married and the Queen made him leave them on the side of the plate. I’ve only bin married to the first Mr Ogg for a month before he was getting out of the bath if he needed to pee. You can refine a husband.

  

Hard to have faith, ain’t it, when you read too many books?

  

You say that you people don’t burn folk and sacrifice people any more, but that’s what true faith would mean, y’see? Sacrificin’ your own life, one day at a time, to the flame, declarin’ the truth of it, workin’ for it, breathin’ the soul of it. THAT’S religion. Anything else is just… is just bein’ NICE. And a way of keepin’ in touch with the neighbours. 

  

The night felt warmer. She could feel greenness in the ground, uncoiling. The year was past the edge, heading away from the dark… Of course, dark would come again, but that was in the nature of the world. Many things were beginning.
