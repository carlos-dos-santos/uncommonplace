Experience is simply the name we give our mistakes. #oscarwilde

I cried that night. But not for what we lose. It is who we are that moves me, time and again, in the hospice. When people ask me if my job is depressing, I reply that nothing could be further from the truth. All that is good in human nature – courage, compassion, our capacity to love – is here in its most distilled form. So often, so reliably, I witness people rising to their best, on facing the worst. I am surrounded by human beings at their finest. #rachelclarke [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jan/18/all-that-is-good-in-human-nature-is-here-rachel-clarke-on-life-and-death-at-her-nhs-hospice](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jan/18/all-that-is-good-in-human-nature-is-here-rachel-clarke-on-life-and-death-at-her-nhs-hospice)

Use what talents you possess; the woods would be very silent if no birds sang there except those that sang best.
