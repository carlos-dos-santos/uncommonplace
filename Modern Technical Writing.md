 In the software industry, you often hear the questions "What does good look like?" and "How do you measure success?". For a documentation website, any answer should include some mix of metrics, bug numbers, reader feedback, alignment with corporate strategy (if applicable), and finally, personal intuition. If you have access to metrics from other teams, comparative analysis often yields the most valuable insights. 
 
 Detecting the difference between good and great documentation is an incredibly difficult, unsolved problem, but that doesn't mean we can give up trying to solve it. 
 
 If you aren't keeping an eye on documentation metrics, you're making a huge mistake. User research is wonderful, but knowing exactly which pages are most popular, your site's bounce rate, and common behavioural flows are all invaluable. 
 
 Writers have to make assumptions in order to achieve anything useful. Bare minimum, we assume that people can read. #writing #assumption
 
 Don't write. .Don't write often, anyway. Technical writers, first and foremost, are testers and researchers. Your job is to know what people want to achieve and precisely how to achieve it. Communicating that knowledge is the last step of the process and really shouldn't comprise more than 10% of your time. 
 
 When people say, "I was writing all day", they don't mean they were intermittently typing for eight straight hours. They mean they spent the entire day engaged in the writing process. And a big part of that process is installing, configuring, and testing software. In other words, learning. #learning #trying-or-attempting #software #technology #writing
 
 Exceptional technical writers are force multipliers within the software industry. Great documentation makes new hires productive in days instead of weeks, prevents thousnads of calls to customer support, is the difference between crippling downtime and rock solid stability, and inspires true, fervent love of development platforms. Technical writing matters. #meaningfulness 
 
 None of these candidates seemed to give any thought to their readers' actual needs, preferring their own criteria for what consituted a job well done. They used phrases like "clear, concise, correct, and complete" and avoided words like "searchable", "scannable", "attractive", and most egregiously, "useful".
