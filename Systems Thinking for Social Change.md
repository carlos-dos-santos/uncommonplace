Systems are perfectly designed to achieve the results they are currently achieving.  
  
From a systems thinking perspective, the key is to help participants cultivate a deep awareness of current reality as something they have created instead of as something

Lewis Thomas, the award-winning medical essayist observed “when you are confronted by any complex social system … with things about it that you’re dissatisfied with and anxious to fix, you cannot just step in and set about fixing with much hope of helping. This is one of the sore discouragements of our time \[...\] if you want to fix something you are first obliged to understand \[...\] the whole system.”  

People’s good intentions to improve social systems are often undermined when they apply conventional thinking to chronic, complex social problems.

Telling stories is a powerful way to make sense of our own experience and the world around us. Stories shape our identity, communicate who we are and what is important to us, and move others to act. They are a primary way of distilling and coding information in memorable form.

The ancient Sufi story of the blind men and the elephant illustrates the challenge of enabling diverse stakeholders to see the big picture.  

The challenge \[was\] to help them expand their perceptions by appreciating how their success depended on the success of all the other stakeholders (including those not present at the meeting), and then motivating them to collaborate more effectively with one another.

Increasing self-awareness is an intervention in and of itself, and the precursor to making any other changes.

\[Jim Collins in Good to Great suggests\] how social sector organisations can develop their own engines of success. He believes that success in the social sector hinges on the ability to grow organisations (not just programs) by building a brand that attracts support, which yields demonstrable results and in turn strengthens the brand. 

In other words, opportunity breeds success, success breeds opportunity - and the reverse is also true.

While money spent by people on acquiring goods may provide more comfort, it does not necessarily increase their access to the factors of production required to create more wealth.

As Otto Scharmer observed based on his work with Ed Schein, professor emeritus of management at MIT, the primary job of leadership is to “enhance the individual and systemic capacity to see, to deeply attend to the reality that people face and enact”.

Asking people to propose reforms to an existing system can lead them to think that they are not part of the system, and hence not part of the problem. Systems thinking enables people to see how they are part of the problem, which ironically increases their ability to develop effective solutions.

When people come to understand that they are connected in non-obvious and often counterproductive ways, they begin to appreciate the bigger picture and not just their part in it. 

The Ladder of Inference is an excellent tool for helping people distinguish what they think from the larger reality around them It shows how people select certain data out of an almost infinite pool of available data, make assumptions and draw conclusions based on the data they select, make recommendations and take action based on these conclusions, and then look for new data to reinforce their original assumptions. #data
