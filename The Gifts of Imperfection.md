We can talk about courage and love and compassion until we sound like a greeting card store, but unless we’re willing to have an honest conversation about what gets in the way of putting these into practice in our daily lives, we will never change. Never, ever. 

Courage sounds great, but we need to talk about how it requires us to let go of what other people think, and for most people, that’s scary. Compassion is something we all want, but are we willing to look at why boundary-setting and saying no is a critical component of compassion? Are we willing to say no, even if we’re disappointing someone? Belonging is an essential component of wholehearted living, but first we have to cultivate self-acceptance - why is this such a struggle? 


It’s only been in the last few years that I’ve learned that playing down the exciting stuff doesn’t take the pain away when it doesn’t happen. It does, however, minimise the joy when it does happen. It also creates a lot of isolation. Once you’ve diminished the importance of something, your friends are not likely to call and say, “I’m sorry that didn’t work out. I know you were excited about it.”


During the interviews, it blew my mind when I realised that many of the truly committed compassion practitioners were also the most boundary-conscious people in the study. Compassionate people are boundaried people. I was stunned. 


We live in a blame culture - we want to know whose fault it is and how they’re going to pay. In our personal, social, and political worlds, we do a lot of screaming and finger-pointing, but we rarely hold people accountable. How could we? We’re so exhausted from ranting and raving that we don’t have the energy to develop meaningful consequences and enforce them. From Washington, DC, and Wall Street to our own schools and homes, I think this rage-blame-too-tired-and-busy-to-follow-through mind-set is why we’re so heavy on self-righteous anger and low on compassion. 

  

As we think about the definition of connection and how easy it is to mistake technology for connecting, we also need to consider letting go of the myth of self-sufficiency. One of the greatest barriers to connection is the cultural importance we place on “going it alone”. Somehow we’ve come to equate success with not needing anyone. Many of us are willing to extend a helping hand, but we’re very reluctant to reach out for help when we need it ourselves. It’s as if we’ve divided the world into “those who offer help” and “those who need help”. The truth is that we are both. 

  

Relational concepts don’t translate into bubbled answer sheets. Relationship and connection happen in an indefinable space between people, a space that will never be fully known or understood by us. Everyone who risks explaining love and belonging is hopefully doing the best they can to answer an unanswerable question. 

  

When I’m tired or stressed, I can be mean and blaming - especially toward my husband, Steve. If I truly love Steve (and, oh man, I do), then how I behave every day is as important, if not more important, than saying “I love you” every day. When we don’t practice love with the people we claim to love, it takes a lot out of us. Incongruent living is exhausting. 

  

Resilience is often a slow unfolding of understanding. What did that experience mean to me? What were the gremlins mumbling? Not only do we need to own our story and love ourselves in the process, we have to figure out the real story! We also have to learn how we protect ourselves from shame if we want to develop worthiness. 

  

The idea that we can choose authenticity makes most of us feel both hopeful and exhausted. We feel hopeful because being real is something we value. Most of us are drawn to warm, down-to-earth, honest people and we aspire to be like that in our own lives. We feel exhausted because without even giving it too much thought, most of us know that choosing authenticity in a culture that dictates everything from how much we’re supposed to weigh to what our homes are supposed to look like is a huge undertaking

  

It’s not so much the act of authenticity that challenges the status quo - I think of it as the audacity of authenticity. Most of us have shame triggers around being perceived as self-indulgent or self-focused. We don’t want our authenticity to be perceived as selfish or narcissistic. 

  

It’s easy to attack and criticise someone while he or she is risk-taking - voicing an unpopular opinion or sharing a new creation with the world or trying something new that he or she hasn’t quite mastered. Cruelty is cheap, easy, and rampant. It’s also chicken-shit. Especially when you attack and criticise anonymously - like technology allows so many people to do these days. As we struggle to be authentic and brave, it’s important to remember that cruelty always hurts, even if the criticisms are untrue. 

  

Courage is telling our story, not being immune to criticism. Staying vulnerable is a risk we have to take if we want to experience connection. 

  

Perfectionism is not self-improvement. Perfectionism is, at its core, about trying to earn approval and acceptance. 

  

Hope is not an emotion; it’s a way of thinking or a cognitive process. Emotions play a supporting role, but hope is really a thought process made up of what \[C. R.\] Snyder calls a trilogy of goals, pathway and agency. 

  

Joy is as thorny and sharp as any of the dark emotions. To love someone fiercely, to believe in something with your whole heart, to celebrate a fleeting moment in time, to fully engage in a life that doesn’t come with guarantees - these are risks that involve vulnerability and often pain. When we lose our tolerance for discomfort, we lose joy. In fact, addiction research shows us that an intensely positive experience is as likely to cause a relapse as an intensely painful experience. 

  

I didn’t find that any one interpretation of spirituality has the corner on the resilience market. It’s not about denominations or dogma. Practicing spirituality is what brings healing and creates resilience. \[...\] We all have to define spirituality in a way that inspires us. 

  

“What begins as a simple expression of the hurried life, or even the challenged life, grows into the great justification for an unfulfilled life” - Lynne Twist

  

Lynne says that addressing scarcity doesn’t mean searching for abundance but rather choosing a mindset of sufficiency. 

  

I realised how many of us have bought into the idea that something has to be extraordinary to bring us joy. 

  

I learned the most about the value of ordinary from interviewing men and women who have experienced tremendous loss such as the loss of a child, violence, genocide, and trauma. The memories that they held most sacred were the ordinary, everyday moments. 

  

In my research, I found that what silences our intuitive voice is our need for certainty. Most of us are not very good at not knowing. We like sure things and guarantees.

  

Comparison is all about conformity and competition. \[...\] The comparison mandate becomes this crushing paradox of “fit in and stand out!” It’s not cultivate self-acceptance, belonging, and authenticity; it’s be just like everyone else, but better. 

  

“I’m not very creative” doesn’t work. There’s no such thing as creative people and non-creative people. There are only those who use their creativity and those who don’t. Unused creativity doesn’t just disappear. It lives within us until it’s expressed, neglected to death, or suffocated by resentment and fear. \[...\] The only unique contribution that we will ever make in this world will be born of our creativity. 

  

When we don’t give ourselves permission to be free, we rarely tolerate that freesome in others. We put them down, make fun of them, ridicule their behaviours, and sometimes shame them. We can do this unconsciously or intentionally. 

  

Meaningful change is a process.**
