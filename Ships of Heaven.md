(The private life of Britain's cathedrals)

#christopher-somerville

When you can see Heaven reflected in 120 different shades of marble polished to glassy perfection, why settle for anything duller? 

  

“The most poetic thing for me about \[Westminster Cathedral\]”, \[Jeremy Dixon says\] after gazing around and overhead, “is that its magical appearance, the marble below and the dark vaults above, is in fact a creative accident, one of the best examples I know, resulting from there not being enough money to cover the whole thing in mosaic. The detail just stops, halfway up the wall. It’s a cathedral of halves: incredible detail in the bottom half, and plain bricks above, blackened by the smoke from incense and all those candles. You get a clear sense of two worlds - the world below, full of colour and detail and human movement, held down by the hanging lights, and then, above that, a still world of mysterious dark. The tremendous darkness of the whole of the upper church, the strength and simplicity of the materials, gives a degree of abstraction which you don’t get in Gothic churches, and which I find very appealing.""
