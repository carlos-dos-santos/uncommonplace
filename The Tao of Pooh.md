But sometimes the knowledge of the scholar is a bit hard to understand because it doesn't seem to match up with our own experience of things. In other words, Knowledge and Experience do not necessarily speak the same language. But isn't the knowledge that comes from experience more valuable than the knowledge that doesn't?

A saying from the area of Chinese medicine would be appropriate to mention here: "one disease, long life; no disease, short life." In other words, those who know what's wrong with them and take care of themselves accordingly will tend to live a lot longer than those who consider themselves perfectly healthy and neglect their weaknesses. So, in that sense at least, a Weakness can do you a big favor, IF you acknowledge that it's there. \[...\] Once you face and understand your limitations, you can work WITH them, instead of having them work against you and get in your way, which is what they do when you ignore them, whether you realize it or not. And then you will find that, in many cases, your limitations can be your strengths.

Now that we know the principle, we can look at its applications. As we have recognized by now, no two snowflakes, trees or animals are alike. No two PEOPLE are the same, either. Everything has its own Inner Nature. Unlike other forms of life, though, people are easily led away from what's right for them, because people have Brain, and Brain can be fooled. Inner Nature, when relied on, cannot be fooled. But many people do not look at it or listen to it, and consequently do not understand themselves very much. Having little understanding of themselves, they have little respect for themselves, and are therefore easily influenced by others.

So quite often, the easiest way to get rid of a Minus is to change it into a Plus. Sometimes you will find that characteristics you try hard to eliminate eventually come back, anyway. But if you do the right things, they will come back in the right ways. And sometimes those very tendencies that you dislike the most can show up in the right way at the right time to save your life, somehow. If that's ever happened to you, you'll think twice before setting out to completely Unbounce yourself.

But with an overwhelming number of people, to misquote an old Western philosopher, it's a case of "I think, therefore I am Confused"

"If people were superior to animals, they'd take better care of the world."

Our Bisy Backson religions, sciences, and business ethics have tried their hardest to convince us that there is a Great Reward waiting for us somewhere, and that what we have to do it spend our lives working like lunatics to catch up with it. Whether it's up in the sky, behind the next molecule, or in the executive suite, it's somehow always farther along that we are - just down the road, on the other side of the world, past the moon, beyond the stars...

The main problem with this great obsessions for Saving Time is very simple: you can't SAVE time. You can only spend it. But you can spend it wisely or foolishly.The Bisy Backson has practically no time at all, because he's too busy wasting it by trying to save it. And by trying to save every bit of it, he ends up wasting the whole thing.

In the sixty-seventh chapter of the Tao Te Ching, Lao-tse \[...\] wrote: "From caring comes courage." We might add that from it also comes wisdom. It's rather significant, we think, that those who have no compassion have no wisdom. Knowledge, yes; cleverness, maybe; wisdom, no. A clever mind is not a heart. Knowledge doesn't really care. Wisdom does.

\[The Snowball Effect\] principle can work negatively or positively. It can promote cynicism as easily as it can encourage hope.

While a Clear mind listens to a bird singing, the Stuffed-Full-of-Knowledge-and-Cleverness mind thinks what KIND of bird is singing. The more Stuffed Up it is, the less it can hear through its own ears and see through its own eyes. Knowledge and Cleverness tend to concern themselves with the wrong sorts of things, and a mind confused by Knowledge, Cleverness and Abstract Ideas tends to go off chasing after things that don't matter, or that don't even exist, instead of seeing, appreciating, and making use of what is right in front of it.

Gathering, analyzing, sorting, and storing information - these functions and more the mind can perform so automatically, skilfully, and effortlessly that it makes the most sophisticated computer look like a plastic toy by comparison. But it can do infinitely more. \[...\] the power of a clear mind is beyond description.
