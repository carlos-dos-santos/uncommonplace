Many of us are interested in how to work better, but we don’t think very much about how to rest better.

With a few notable exceptions, today’s leaders treat stress and overwork as a badge of honor, brag about how little sleep and how few vacation days they take, and have their reputations as workaholics carefully tended by publicists and corporate PR firms. They remind us how the working lives of even the most powerful people unfold in an environment saturated with the unquestioned assumptions about the virtue and inescapable necessity of constant work. Whether we embrace the idea that overwork is essential for productivity and creativity or reject it, we are all defined by it.

Rest is not something that the world gives us. It’s never been a gift. It’s never been something you do when you’ve finished everything else. If you want rest, you have to take it. You have to resist the lure of busyness, make time for rest, take it seriously, and protect it from a world that is intent on stealing it.

These philosophical arguments might seem arcane, but the assumptions that knowledge is produced rather than discovered or revealed, that the amount of work that goes into an idea determines its importance, and that the creation of all ideas can be organised and institutionalised, all guide our thinking about work today. When we treat workaholics as heroes, we express a belief that labor rather than contemplation is the wellspring of great ideas and that the success of individuals and companies is a measure of their long hours.

Cognitively, reading is a pretty complicated activity, since it can involve several different skills at once, from the recognition of letters and the interpretation of a phrase to the construction of a mental picture of a scene or comparison to a previous work, and neuroscientists are keen to understand how these connected regions (or connectomes) work together.

Scott Adams: “\[creativity\] is not something you can summon on command. The best you can do is set an attractive trap and await. My mornings are the trap.”

Writers and composers who shut themselves in their studies in the early morning are \[...\] creating environments rich in helpful distractions at a time when their creative minds are more likely to be responsive to them and better able to use them to form new associations and insights.

The reason it’s necessary to start writing, and to keep writing, is that creativity doesn’t drive the work; the work drives creativity. A routine creates a landing place for the muse.

Raymond Chandler: “there should be a space of time, say four hours a day at the least, when a professional writer doesn’t do anything but write.” You don’t have to write during those hours, but you can’t do anything else. 

But what if you aren’t inspired? Ingmar Bergman said that it is necessary to “sit down pedantically every day at a definite time, irrespective of whether you’re in the mood or not.” Tchaikovsky believed that “a self-respecting artist must not fold his hands on the pretext that he is not in the mood.” Joyce Carol Oates agreed: “one must be pitiless about this matter of ‘mood’” and start writing no matter what; “the writing will create the mood.” Trollope ridiculed this idea that “the man who works with his imagination should allow himself to wait till inspiration moves him.” As far as he was concerned, “it would not be more absurd if the shoemaker were to wait for inspiration.”

Dreams are a product of the roiling chaos of the subconscious

Wilder Penfield: “The best rest for doing one thing is doing another until you fall into a sound sleep. It is the vigorous use of idle time that will broaden your education, make you a more efficient specialist, a happier man, a more useful citizen. It will help you to understand the rest of the world and make you more resourceful.

A musical performance and a start-up both involve getting very talented people to work together and do great work on a deadline. You might think that their similarity would make music a less useful as a form of recovery, but because doing it well demands commitment, concentration, organisational skill, and cooperation, and channels some of the same energy and skill normally used on the job into a completely different context, playing music seems to promote recovery from work.

These results \[that longer holidays don’t often translate to greater happiness\] undermine the idea that our mental energies refill with time, rather than through activities that promote recovery. They also suggest that we should reassess the role of breaks, and the rhythm of vacations, in our lives.

We live in an era when we’re urged to be passionate about our work, to regard the boundary between work and life as an obsolete relic of the industrial age. Mobile technologies keep us connected to the workplace day and night. At the same time, the boundaries between work and life are blurred, giving us more flexibility and choice about how to organise our time. Together, they create the illusion that we’ll find greatest fulfillment, and be most effective, if we’re always working

Whatever form it takes, deep play provides some of the same challenges and satisfactions as work, at small scale or more immediate form. It offers a chance to develop additional skills and perspective on life. It provides a way to unify what might be disparate and scattered activities into a unified whole, a life that is greater than the sum of its parts.

\[Gate’s trips don’t\] sound terribly restful, but by now it shouldn’t come as a surprise that the right kind of strenuous activity, done under the right circumstances, can be restorative. 

Deliberate rest is not a negative space defined by the absence of work or something that we hope to get sometime. It is something positive, something worth cultivating in its own right. 

This kind of calm is also valuable in workplaces that expect high levels of emotional engagement. As sociologist William Davies argues, today’s workers are told that passion is their greatest asset and that they should do what they love (or at least love what they do); employers, meanwhile, have some to see happiness as a strategic resource that boosts employee productivity, decreases absenteeism and turnover, and increases customer satisfaction. \[...\] It’s deployed as a kind of weaponized positive psychology, in which automated systems watch for signs of discontent \[...\], indicators that happiness is at suboptimal levels. In environments like these, the ability to detach from a workplace that wants to commoditize your emotional life, and to cultivate a private life rather than succumb to easy alternatives that keep you in the office, is more valuable than ever. 

In his essay on recreation published in his 1895 book “The Use of Life”, John Lubbock makes a distinction between idleness and leisure: “Leisure is one of the grandest blessings, ideless one of the greatest curses,” he argues, and “one is the source of happiness, and the other of misery.”

When we treat rest as work’s equal and partner, recognise it as a playground for the creative mind and springboard for new ideas, and see it as an activity that we can practice and improve, we elevate rest into something that can help calm our days, organise our lives, give us more time, and help us achieve more while working less.
