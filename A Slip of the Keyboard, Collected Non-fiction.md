Most \[science-fiction\] writers in the field were fans once; many fans aspire to be writers one day.

Brewer’s flowered in those pre-Trivial Pursuit days when people believed that if you patiently accumulated a knowledge of small things a knowledge of big things would automatically evolve, and you would become a better person.

People are magnificent research, almost the best there is.

More than half the skill of writing lies in tricking the book out of your own head.

But horizontal wealth means not letting your increased income dictate your tastes. You like books and now you have money? Buy more books! Change those catenary bookshelves for good hardwood ones! In my case, build a library extension to your office. And, of course, you buy what will be useful for that most wonderful of pursuits, blind research, which is research without direction for the sheer joy of it.

Where do you get your fantastic ideas from? You steal them. You steal them from reality. It outstrips fantasy most of the time.

I read and read and read throughout my teens. \[...\] I haunted all the bookshops. I read every book I could find. I picked up stuff like a Hoover, and remembered it out of the sheer joy of finding out that the universe is stuffed with interest. Knowledge kind of drifted down out of the atmosphere.

Read with the mindset of a carpenter looking at trees.

Genres are also - fantasy perhaps most of all - a big bulging pantry of plots, conceits, races, character types, myths, devices and directions, most of them hallowed by history. You’re allowed to borrow, as many will have done before you \[...\] to stay with the cookery metaphor, they’re all just ingredients. What matters is how you bake the cake; every decent author should have their own recipe, and the best find new things to add to the mix.

Fantasy is the Ur-literature, from which everything else sprang. \[...\] So let’s not get frightened when the children read fantasy. It is compost for a healthy mind. It stimulates inquisitive nodes. It may not appear as ‘relevant’ as books set more firmly in the child’s environment, or whatever the hell the writer believes to be the child’s environment, but there is some evidence that a rich internal fantasy life is as good and necessary for a child as health soil is for a plant, for much the same reasons.

"I remember it like a movie. There I was, sitting on this rather chilly sixties-style couch in this rather bare room; but at the edges of the carpet, the forest began. I remember the light as green, coming through trees. I have never since then so truly had the experience of being inside the story. \[...\] I used to read it once a year, in the spring. I’ve realized that I don’t anymore, and I wonder why. It’s not the dense and sometimes ponderous language. It’s not because the scenery has more character than the characters, or the lack of parts for women, or the other perceived or real offences against the current social codes. It’s simply because I have the movie in my head, and it’s been there for forty years. I can still remember the luminous green of the beech woods, the freezing air of the mountains, the terrifying darkness of the dwarf mines, the greenery on the slopes of Ithilien, west of Mordor, still holding out against the encroaching shadow. The protagonists don’t figure much in the movie, because they were never more to me than figures in a landscape that was, itself, the hero. I remember it at least as clearly as—no, come to think of it, more clearly than—I do many of the places I’ve visited in what we like to call the real world. In fact, it is strange to write this and realize that I can remember stretches of the Middle-earth landscape as real places. The characters are faceless, mere points in space from which their dialogue originated. But Middle-earth is a place I went to."

Far more beguiling than the idea that evil can be destroyed by throwing a piece of expensive jewellery into a volcano is the possibility that evil can be diffused by talking. The fantasy of justice is more interesting than the fantasy of fairies, and more truly fantastic.

Authors tend to have packrat minds as a matter of course, and I suspect that my mind packs more rats than most.

Ignorance is a wonderful thing - it’s the state you have to be in before you can really learn anything.

We’re not doing it right. We get handed all this new technology and we’re just not up to scratch. And that’s just as well, because the dream as sold is pretty suspect, too. It’s a worldwide community, provided you use American English. It’s a wonderful tool for business, if you’re the right kind of business - that is to say, one that doesn’t make anything except losses. It brings people together, if your idea of social intercourse is an in-basket full of spam written by people with the social skills of pig dribble. It’s a wonderful education tool, if what you want to learn is how to download other people’s work straight into your essay. What we are, in fact, is electronic apemen.

We live in a venal world run largely by men who count numbers and, because they can count people, they think people are numbers.

For the whole of my life since I was nine years old I have enjoyed words, not necessarily words organised, simply some words all by themselves, such as conundrum and onomatopoeia and susurration, words that somehow seemed to speak back.
