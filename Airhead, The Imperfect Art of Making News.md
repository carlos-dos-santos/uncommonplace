‘Maybe,’ Ryan concedes. ‘But I do think this is an important step. I think we’ve got to lose our fun for a second. Take a step back. Because I think a lot of guys were having all the fun. It can’t be at the expense of anyone. Maybe we’ve got to take a step back and allow the stories to be told and these people to heal so that a gesture that may be harmless or misguided won’t cut so deep or hurt so bad. I think it’s a necessary step. Now that we’re finding out about all these stories and all these things that women went through, we might need to acknowledge it for a minute.’

As if I am scared to universalize what I’ve been through: a thoroughly female trait, I now realise, never to want to ‘speak for other women’s experiences’. Except if not now, then when?
