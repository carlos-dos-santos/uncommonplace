To make progress, above all else, you must ensure that some of your projects finish. 

Finally, the one thing that I've found at  ompanies with very few interruptions and have observed almost nowhere else: really great, consistently available documentation. It's probably even harder to bootstrap documentation into a non-documenting company than it is to bootstrap unit tests into a non-testing company, but the best solution to frequent interruptions I've seen is a culture of documentation, documentation reading, and a documentation search that actually works. 

Organizational debt is the organizational sibling of technical debt, and it represents things like biased interview systems and inequitable compensation mechanisms. these are systemic problems that are preventing your oganization from reaching its potential. 

As an organizational leader, you'll always have a portfolio of risk, and you'll always be doing badly at some things that are important to you. That's not only okay, it's unavoidable. 

The best changes often go unnoticed, moving from one moment of stability to another, with teams and organizations feeling stable at every step. 

The key tools for leading efficient change are systems thinking, metrics, and vision. 

When the steps of change are too wide, teams get destabilized, and gaps open within them. In those moments, managers create stability by becoming glue. 

Product management is an iterative elimination tournament, with each round consisting of problem discovery, problem selection, and solution validation. 

Taking the time to evaluate which problem to solve is one of the best predictors I've found of a team's long-term performance. 

Folks are often comfortable with hard decisions in the abstract, but struggle to translate policies into the specific steps to implement them. 

The act of writing strategy leads oflks through a systematic analysis, so, even if we don't share them, writing these documents helps us work through quite a few challenges, both overwhelming and mundane. 

People sometimes describe strategy as artful or sophisticated, but I've found that the hardest part of writing a good strategy is pretty mundane. You must be honest about the constraints that are making the challenge difficult, which almost always include people and organizational aspects that are uncomfotable to acknowledge. No extent of artistry can solve a problem that you're unwilling to admit.

I've found metrics to be an extremely effective way to lead change with little or no organizational authority. 

What's so powerful about nudges is that simply letting folks know that their behaviour has changed will typicall stir them to action, and it doesn't require any sort of organizational authority to do so. 

You unravel most puzzles knowing they're solvable.

Management is an ethical profession, and our decisions matter, especially the hard ones. 

Policy success is directly dependent on how we handle requests for exception. 

Folks who communicate a no effectively are not the firmest speakers, nor do they make frequent use of the word. They are able to convincingly explain their team's constraints and articulate why the proposed path is either unattainable or undesirable. 

I believe that almost every internal problem can be traced back to a missing or poor relationship, and that with great relationships it is possible to come together and solve almost anything. 

I try to start debugging problems from the relationship angle, and I find this technique pretty effective. 

A few years back, one of the leaders I worked ith told me, "With the right people, any process works, and with the wrong people, no process works."

The best management philosphy never stands still, but - in the model of the HEgelian dialectic - continues to evolve as it comes into contact with reality. 

The worst theory of management is to not have one at all, but the second worst is one that doesn't change. 

All slow-growth environments used to be high growth environments.

Be thoughtful about carrying your values with you from one context to another. Leadership is matching appropriate action to your current context, and it's pretty uncommon that any two situations will flourish from the same behaviours. 

In Pearl S. Buck's "The Good Earth", she writes "All power comes from the Earth." In management, power comes from a healthy team. 

You can always find an opportunity to increase your scope and learning even in a company that doesn't have room for more directors or vice presidents. 

In the long run our measure is not in what we say or how skillfully we say it, but in what we do, and the abacus tallying our actions is organizational culture. 

An inclusive organization is one in which individuals have opportunity and membership. Opportunity is having access to professional success and development. MEmbership is participating as a version of themselves that they feel comfortable with. 

Good process is as lightweight as possible, while being rigorous enough to consistently work. 

One of the observations from systems thinking is that, though humans are prone to interpreting events as causal, often problems are better described in terms of a series of stockpiles that grow and shrink based on incoming and outgoing flows. 

Don't treat growth as a foregone conclusion. Growth only comes from change, and that is something you can influence.

Being unprepared is, in my opinion, the cardinal interview sin, because it shows a disinterest in the candidate's time, your team's time, and your own time.
