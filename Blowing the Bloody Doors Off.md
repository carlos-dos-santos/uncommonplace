Success comes from doing. The best way to keep doing enough of the right things is to keep doing a lot of things. Even if some of those things end up being flops, you’ll be building up your experience, building relationships, building confidence, opening up opportunities, keeping life fresh and learning your craft. So as long as enough of them are good enough, you will be allowed to keep going.

My point is that, in my experience, the best directors, like the best leaders in other industries, achieve great things by gathering the right people around them, then trusting them to get on with what they do best, giving them a quiet nudge whenever they need it to keep them on track. That tends to make everyone - actors and crew - do their best work: happy, productive and tremendously loyal.

(re comparing yourself to other people) The only time it is useful for me to decide how talented another actor is, is when I’m considering working with him or when I’m already working with him and trying to learn from him. Because I only want to work with the best and I only want to learn from the best. Other than that, it’s of no interest.

Now there is just no point in reading \[reviews\]. A good review won’t help me, and a bad one won’t destroy me.

In my experience, the most surprising thing about becoming a star is that it changes everything and nothing. 

There are people who are able to say “That was a disaster” without saying “I am therefore a failure.” And there are people who cannot.

The only way to be sure you never fail is to never do anything at all. And the only way to really, truly fail is not to learn from your failures. Any time you learn from a failure, it’s a success. 

And my mum taught me that the worst thing you can do to an enemy is to ignore him. To be angry is to be a victim. To move on is the only victory.
