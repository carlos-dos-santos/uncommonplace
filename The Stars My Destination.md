a man is a member of society first, and an individual second. you must go along with society, whether it chooses destruction or not 

‘there’s got to be more to life than just living,’ foyle said to the robot.

‘then find it for yourself, sir. don’t ask the world to stop moving because you have doubts.’

‘why can’t we all move forward together?’

‘because you’re all different. you’re not lemmings. some must lead, and hope that the rest will follow.’

‘who leads?’

‘the men who must… driven men, compelled men.’

‘freak men.’

‘you’re all freaks, sir. but you have always been freaks. life is a freak. that’s its hope and glory.’

‘thank you very much.’

‘my pleasure, sir.’

‘ you’ve saved the day.’

‘always a lovely day somewhere, sir,’ the robot beamed. then it fizzed, jangled, and collapsed.

‘who the hell are we to make decisions for the world just because we’re compulsive? let the world make its own choice between life and death. why should we be saddled with the responsibility?’

‘we’re not saddled,’ yang yeovil said quietly. ‘we’re driven. we’re forced to seize the responsibility that the average man shirks.’

‘then let him stop shirking it. let him stop tossing his duty and guilt onto the shoulders of the first freak who comes along grabbing at it. are to be scapegoats for the world forever?’

‘damn you!’ dagenham raged. ‘don’t you realise that you can’t trust people? they don’t know enough for their own good.’

‘then let them learn or die. we’re all in this together. let’s live together or die together.’

d’you want to die in their ignorance? you’ve got to figure out how we can get those slugs back without blowing everything wide open.’

‘no. i believe in them. i was one of them before i turned tiger. they can all turn uncommon if they’re kicked awake like i was.’
