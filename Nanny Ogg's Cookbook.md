Few authors can make a long-term living out of poisoning their readers, at least physically.

The world is full of fools, and you are not allowed to object to that, even though passive stupidity kills so many people.

As I have indicated, it is perfectly etiquettable to arrange your life so that everything ends cleanly, and a witch who dies just as the last log from the pile is smoulderin' in the hearth will get a reputation for being prudent as well as, of course, being dead.

Life is full of little tricks and if you're allowed to go around again, well, they don't let you take the notes you made the first time. I hope my efforts will provide you will a sketch map.

But really, etiquette is a state of mind. You never know what tomorrow will bring. It might hold a problem no one has yet had to face. So therefore you need to get your mind right for when you venture into areas where no book is going to help you. Remember: someone had to be the first person in the world to eat an oyster.

In that case, my advice is to try a nice open smile, although admittedly this won't get you far with shellfish. I do find it gets me out of trouble with people nine times out of ten, and even if it does get me into trouble it's generally int'resting trouble and leads to warm memories. You couldn't buy them for money.
