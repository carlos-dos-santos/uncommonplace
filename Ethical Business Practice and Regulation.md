paradoxically, at present, too many regulatory systems are built around the idea that anyone who breaks a rule is bad and that breaking rules needs to be deterred by strong punishment. this approach, however, is preventing ethical behaviour rather than increasing it

  

an important barometer of a regulatory system is how it reacts when things go wrong. there is now a clear science and experience that we only learn from mistakes if we can openly share information on why the mistakes happened and identify the root cause. \[...\] if we focus solely on blame every time something goes wrong, people become defensive and we will never learn, we will never fix problems and we will destroy the relationships that would allow us to learn and improve

  

richard barrett says that 'values-driven organisations are the most successful organisations on the planet'

  

success is so often based on the strength of social relationships, even at work - if those relationships are ethical, this drives good outcomes

  

behavioural psychology supports two key findings that reinterpret older ideas. first, increasing the severity or certainty of punishment alone in fact results in only modest (if any) increases in deterrence. \[...\] second, the idea that a person will obey a rule out of fear of being punished has been shown to be effective only where an individual perceives there to be a high risk that he or she will be identified, from which he or she will suffer embarrassment and the loss of reputational esteem 

  

if a repressive and deterrent approach is adopted towards people who think that they are trying to get things right, it will reduce their willingness to comply and collaborate, and there is little evidence that it will induce them to ensure that their future behaviour complies with the rules - in fact, quite the reverse

  

the traditional approach is to 'enforce' the law on those who have broken the rules so as to 'deter' them and everyone else from breaking it in future. yet historical ideas of 'command and control' regulation and of 'deterrence' as an effective means of 'enforcement' have all crumbled in the face of advances in knowledge about how people make decisions and behave. deterrence is a theory, but scientific evidence supports a more responsive approach in most cases. 

  

\[...\] the collaborative basis on which a joint enterprise such as a business operates will be threatened if some people try to undermine it by criminal activity, even if the business receives some gains as a result. the behaviour is essentially selfish and anti-social, as opposed to collaborative and based on mutual respect, and should be against the cultural code of the organisation.

  

\[re: deepmind and the royal free\] the Information Commissioner: "there's no doubt the huge potential that creative use of data could have on patient care and clinical improvements, but the price of innovation does not need to be the erosion of fundamental privacy rights"

  

francis fukuyama: people who do not trust each other will end up cooperating only under a system of formal rules and regulations, which have to be negotiated, agreed to, litigated, and enforced, sometimes by coercive means. this legal apparatus, serving as a substitute for trust, entails what economists call 'transaction costs'. widespread distrust in society, in other words, imposes a kind of tax on all forms of economic activity, a tax that high-trust societies do not have to pay.

  

so if we want to maximise compliance with a group's rules, we should aim to maximise social pressure to behave in conformity with social groups. this means that we need to strengthen working in groups rather than alone, and focus on the identification, support and leadership of groups, but we also need to have a 'value component' to maximise social pressure to behave ethically, that is, in conformity with the generally shared morality of the relevant human society to which we belong 

  

matt ridley: cooperation is a frequent feature of human society; trust is the very foundation of social and economic life... Trust is as vital a form of social capital as money is a form of actual capital

  

contracts and regulatory systems are proxies and supports for uncertainty in trustworthiness. trust gives sufficient confidence to overcome risk and bridge vulnerability

  

experiments have shown that having strong trust between people is far more effective than trying to affect choices by the threat of punishment. there is strong popular belief in punishment, but it is in fact of little value in terms of affecting future behaviour

  

dennis gentilin: no one wants to put on a 'work face' when they get to the office. no one wants to leave part of their personality and inner life at home. but to be fully present at work, to feel 'psychologically safe,' we must know that we can be free enough, sometimes, to share the things that scare us without fear of recriminations.

  

\[the civil aviation authority\] found that a rules-based system produces a response of 'how do i get around the rule?' and is backward looking, whereas a principles-based approach tries to be forward looking and encourage people to take responsibility for their cultures

  

having a conversation that reveals disagreements is a sign of success in addressing issues

  

secretary of state: but to blame failures in care on doctors and nurses trying to do their best is to miss the point that bad mistakes can be made by good people. what is often overlooked is proper study of the environment and systems in which mistakes happen and to understand what went wrong and encouragement to spread any lessons learned. accountability to future patients as well as to the person sitting in front of you.

  

"safety issues and related incidents are often the result of complex local, organisational and system-wide processes, with similar events recurring repeatedly in different places across the healthcare system. the purpose of safety investigation is to understand the patterns of causality that produce harm, and to make recommendations that can address those causes across the healthcare system in order to improve the safety of all patients."
