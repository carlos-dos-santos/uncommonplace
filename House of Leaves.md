Zampan√≤ himself probably would of insisted on corrections and edits, he was his own harshest critic, but i've come to believe errors, especially written errors, are often the only markers left by a solitary life: to sacrifice them is to lose the angles of a personality, the riddle of a soul

all of it true, though of course scars are much harder to read. their complex inflections do not resemble the reductive ease of any tattoo, no matter how extensive, colorful or elaborate the design. scars are the paler pain of survival, received unwillingly and displayed in the language of injury

  

when revisiting places we once frequented as children, it is not unusual to observe how much smaller everything seems. this experience has too often been attributed to the physical differences between a child and an adult. in fact it has more to do with epistemological dimensions than with bodily dimensions: knowledge is hot water on wool. it shrinks time and space.

little solace comes 

to those who grieve

when thoughts keep drifting

as walls keep shifting

and this great blue world of ours

seems a house of leaves

moments before the wind.

  
  

You Shall Be My Roots

you shall be my roots and 

i will be your shade, 

though the sun burns my leaves.

  

you shall quench my thirst and 

i will feed you fruit,

though time takes my seed.

  

and when i'm lost and can tell nothing of this earth

you will give me hope.

  

and my voice you will always hear.

and my hand you will always have.

  

for i will shelter you. 

and i will comfort you.

and even when we are nothing left,

not even in death,

i will remember you.
