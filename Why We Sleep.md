Sleep is constantly modifying the information architecture of the brain at night.

  

The term 'muscle memory' is a misnomer. Muscles themselves have no such memory; a muscle that is not connected to a brain cannot perform any skilled actions, nor does a muscle store skilled routines. Muscle memory is, in fact, brain memory. Training and strengthening muscles can help you better execute a skilled memory routine. But the routine itself - the memory program - resides firmly and exclusively within the brain.

  

Practice does not make perfect. It is practice, followed by a night of sleep, that leads to perfection.

  

Through its therapeutic work at night, REM sleep perform\[s\] the elegant trick of divorcing the bitter emotional rind from the information-rich fruit. We can therefore learn and usefully recall salient life events without being crippled by the emotional baggage that those painful events originally carried.

  
In short, emotions in appropriate amounts make life worth living.
