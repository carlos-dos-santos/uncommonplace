The ongoing evolution of punk is, to a large extent, driven by internal tensions

  

Rob Fish, from the US hardcore band 108, judges punk's ongoing evolution favourably: "If we cannot appreciate the evolution of our scene," he says, "it's no longer ours"

  

Ian MacKaye: "\[punk is\] a free space \[...\] where new ideas can be presented without bowing to, or being pushed along by, profit motives"

  

Brian D, Catharsis "people get together to make and share art for its own sake rather than a profit-driven enterprise"

  

In hardcore songs, the vocals often function as an additional rhythm instrument rather than as a provider of melody.

  

Lucy O'Brien: "To find fresh meanings as a woman, it was necessary to overturn the pastel shades of post-60s femininity and make an overt statement on a newly-emerging, more aggressive understanding of female sexuality. Punk provided the perfect opportunity."

  

Nevertheless, punk's core message, expressed in a wide variety of ways in the poetry of punk - the song lyrics written and performed by punk rock and hardcore artists - has remained the same: Be an individual, think for yourself, question authority, take control of your life, and as Catharsis put it, "nurture what is beautiful within \[yourself\] and find common cause with others".
