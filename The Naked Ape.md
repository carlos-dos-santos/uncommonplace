Why, if cities are so stressful, do people flock to then? The answer to this question adds a pleasant element to a sometimes depressing picture. For the city, despite all its faults, acts as a giant stimulus-centre where our great inventiveness can flourish and develop. 

If we can imagine it, sooner or later we will be able to do it. 

But even when we have made our mainframe computers look as primitive as clay tablets, we ourselves will still be no more than Naked Apes, made of flesh and blood. Even if, in our relentless quest for progress, we have destroyed all our close animal relatives, we will remain biological phenomenoa, subject to biological rules. 

We never stop investigating. We are never satisfied that we know enough to get by. Every question we answer leads on to another question. This has become the greatest survival trick of our species. 

Writing, a formalized offshoot of picture-making, and verbalized vocal communication have, of course, been developed as our major means of transmitting and recording information, but they have also been utilized as vehicles for aesthetic exploration on an enormous scale. The intricate elaboration of our ancestral grunts and squeaks into complex symbolic speech has enabled us to sit and "play" with thoughts in our heads, and to manipulate our (primarily instructional) word sequences to new ends as aesthetic, experimental playthings.
