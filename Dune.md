There is probably no more terrible instant of enlightenment than the one in which you discover your father is a man - with human flesh.**

**The Fremen were supreme in that quality the ancients called "spannungsbogen" - which is the self-imposed delay between desire for a thing and the act of reaching out to grasp that thing.**

**There is in all things a pattern that is part of our universe. It has symmetry, elegance, and grace - those qualities you find always in that which the true artist captures. You can find it in the turning of the seasons, in the way sand trails along a ridge, in the branch clusters of the creosote bush or the pattern of its leaves. We try to copy these patterns in our lives and our society, seeking the rhythms, the dances, the forms that comfort. Yet, it is possible to see peril in the finding of ultimate perfection. It is clear that the ultimate pattern contains its own fixity. In such perfection, all things move toward death.**
