Countless worlds made from nothing by use of symbols

There are as many different worlds as there are such mutually exclusive truths

Although conception without perception is merely empty, perception without conception is blind (totally inoperative).

Worlds differ in response to theoretical rather than practical needs.

A world may be unmanageably heterogenous or unbearably monotonous according to how events are sorted into kinds. 

The uniformity of nature we marvel at or the unreliability we protest belongs to a world of our own making.

Just as to stress all syllables is to stress none, so to take all classes as relevant kinds is to take none as such. 

Exemplification and expression, though running in the opposite direction from denotation - that is, from the symbol to a literal or metaphorical feature of it instead of to something the symbol applies to - are no less symbolic referential functions and instruments of worldmaking. 

Ratings of relevance, importance, utility, value often yield hierarchies rather than dichotomies. Such weightings are also instances of a particular type of ordering. 

The making of one world out of another usually involves some extensive weeding out and filling - actual excision of some old and supply of some new material. Our capacity for overlooking is virtually unlimited, and what we do take in usually consists of significant fragments and clues that need massive supplementation. Artists often make skillful use of this. 

  

The scientist is no less drastic, rejecting or purifying most of the entities and events of the world of ordinary things while generating quantities of filling for curves suggested by sparse data, and erecting elaborate structures on the basis of meagre observations. Thus does he strive to build a world confirming to his chosen concepts and obeying his universal laws. 

  

For the man-in-the-street, most versions from science, art and perception depart in some ways form the familiar serviceable world he has jerry-built from fragments of scientific and artistic tradition and from his own struggle for survival. This world, indeed, is the one most often taken as real; for reality in a world, like realism in a picture, is largely a matter of habit. 

  

Knowing cannot be exclusively or even primarily a matter of determining what is true. Discovery often amounts, as when I place a piece in a jigsaw puzzle, not to arrival at a proposition for declaration or defense, but to finding a fit. Much of knowing aims at something other than true, or any, belief. An increase in acuity of insight or in range of comprehension, rather than a change in belief, occurs when we find in a pictured forest a face we already knew was there, or learn to distinguish stylistic differences among works already classified by artist or composer or writer, or study a picture of a concerto or a treatise until we see or hear or grasp such features we could not discern before. Such growth in knowledge is not by formation or fixation or belief but by the advancement of understanding. Furthermore, if worlds are as much made as found, so also knowledge is as much remarking as reporting. All the processes of worldmaking I have discussed enter into knowing. 

  

If both packaging and contents are both matters of style, what isnâ€™t? 

  

Style has to do exclusively with the symbolic functioning of a work as such. 

  

What we find, or succeed in making, is heavily dependent on how and what we seek. 

  

Yet the more complicated and elusive the style, the more does it stimulate exploration and reward success with illumination.
