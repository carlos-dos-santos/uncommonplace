Too much of the debate around longevity has been about finances and pensions. Preparing for a 100 year life is about more than just shoring up the finances. You can’t have a long and financially successful career if your skills, health and relationships are depleted. 

  

Issues of identity, choice and risk become central to questions of navigating a long life. A long life means more changes; more stages means more individual choices to be made; and the more change and choices you experience, the less the influence of where you started from. So you will need to think about your identity in a different way from those who came before. 

  

Greater life expectancy is only a good thing if life itself is good. 

  

What if life expectancy increases faster than the years of good health? This would lead to the Hobbesian nightmare as an ‘epidemic of frailty’.

  

If each generation is born as smart as the previous one and inherits their stock of knowledge, then by exploring and combining different aspects of that knowledge and creating new insights, the world progresses technologically. As Isaac Newton brilliantly summarized, we stand on the shoulders of giants. 

  

While assets can last for several periods, they usually suffer from some form of depreciation - that is, they diminish over time due to usage or neglect. This means that assets require careful maintenance and mindful investment. Viewed like this, is it clear why we would consider a friend, or knowledge, or health as an asset. Friends and knowledge don’t disappear in a day, but if you fail to invest by not keeping in contact with a friend or not refreshing your knowledge, then they will eventually depreciate and possibly disappear. 

  

\[What emerged was that\] one of the key predictors of life satisfaction were the deep and strong relationships the men had established throughout their lives. In the words of George Valliant, the study’s pioneer, there are two pillars to happiness: one is love; the other is finding a way of coping with life that doesn’t push love away. Earning more does make you happier, but love makes you happy. 

  

\[the development of IBM’s Watson means\] that with diagnostic augmentation, the skill set for the medical profession will shift from information retrieval to deeper intuitive experience, more person-to-person skills and greater emphasis on team motivation and judgement. 

  

Richard Sennett: “The single most pressing earthly obligation of a medieval artisan was the establishment of a good personal reputation. This was especially an urgent matter for itinerant craftsmen such as goldsmiths, who were strangers in many of the places they worked.”

  

Transformation assets assist \[the process of change\]. They increase the ability to deal with the uncertainty of transition. 

  

The combination of self-knowledge and diverse networks creates the foundations for transformation. But what brings dynamism to this asset are actions, a preparedness to be open to creative solutions, to question old habits and routines, to challenge stereotypes and experiment with new models for integrating the different parts of life, being curious about how others are working and living, and feeling comfortable with the ambiguity that novelty brings. 

  

Adolescence is a time of flexibility - a time for discovering options and keeping them open rather than making commitments. With the lengthening of life, options become more valuable, and so the period over which we explore and create options also lengthens. 

  

Exploring works best when it is a period of genuine experimentation, with as much variety as possible. 

  

When someone makes a successful transition to the portfolio stage, they do so because they are able to change gear and see their working career as the development of competencies rather than accumulation of job titles. Moving from full time employment into a portfolio stage requires flexibility in mental agilities as well as working patterns for which a traditional second-stage career is not always a good preparation. 

  

Creating a sense of identity over a long life, one which recognises the interactions between yourself today and your future selves, is a crucial component of a successful 100-year life. 

  

The higher your rate of consumption and the more you like material goods, then the more years you are likely to spend working.

  

\[Giddens’ concept of the “pure relationship”\] - these are relationships that are no longer based on the traditional contract but are sought only for what the relationship can bring to both partners. Such relationships are reflexively organised and open to constant refashioning and questioning, rather than being static and prone to inertial drag; they have room for manoeuvre. Commitments play a central role in these relationships, as “the committed person is prepared to accept the risks which sacrificing of other potential options entails”. So it depends on mutual trust between the partners: that each is trustworthy, and that their mutual bond can withstand future traumas. Perhaps most importantly for each partner, self-identity is negotiated through self-exploration and the development of intimacy with the other, creating a shared history. 

  

A hundred years provides more time than required by the evolutionary imperative to breed, and more time in which to meet any financial security needs. So what is the purpose of these extra years if not to procreate and accumulate? Might these extra years, distributed throughout a life, bring the time and opportunity to explore who you are and arrive at a way of living that is nearer to your own personal values and hopes than to the traditions of the society into which you were born? If so, then this is perhaps the greatest gift that longevity can bestow. 

  

The challenge of a longer life is that the impacts of mistakes potentially lasts for longer, even if there is time to claw situations back from the edge. This is why we have placed such emphasis on planning and preparation.
