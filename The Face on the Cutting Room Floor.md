'In the fever of city life infatuations are apt to grow like mushrooms. The noise, the hurry and the sensation of being one alone among millions of unknown and therefore very exciting people, make for a curious instability in those who live on what may be called the fringes of the artistic world. What they conceive to be love becomes with them an obsession and the whole of experience'
