There's a feeling of precariousness that makes us appreciate small things like a light to read by or a hot shower more than we used to.

  

Living on a canal boat marks you out in this way. Cuts and splinters, a thumb knuckle seared white, fingernails ingrained with grime, smoke laced hair: these are all the necessary side-effects of keeping a vessel warm.

  

Obviously Pike is our home and she comes with us wherever we go, it's only the location that changes. But still, it's a ruptured way of living. \[...\] We have settled down in a most unsettling sort of way.

  

London's canals have become linear villages; dynamic, travelling townscapes that are eclectic, textured and always shifting about.

  

Whenever someone gets dreamy-eyed about our drifting way of living we're careful to tell them just how challenging it can be. We are free of earthly ties but we're also free of everyday conveniences. We have to fetch our own water and deal intimately with our own waste. We have to create our own power and our own heat. We find ourselves bound to our boat in a way one would never be to bricks and mortar. Sometimes it's a joy and sometimes it's a drain. It is always a big commitment.
