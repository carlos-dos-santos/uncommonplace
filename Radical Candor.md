Now I realised the question that led me to study Russian literature - why some people live productively and joyfully while others feel, as Marx put it, alienated from their labor - was central to a boss’s job. In fact, part of my job was to figure out how to create more joy and less misery. My humanity was an attribute, not a liability, to being effective

  
  

Once people know what it feels like to HAVE a good boss, it’s more natural for them to want to BE a good boss

  
  

Both dimensions of radical candor (care personally, challenge directly) are sensitive to contact. They get measured at the listener’s ear, not at the speaker’s mouth \[…\] remember, the clarity of your guidance gets measured at the other person’s ear, not your mouth.

If you want your team to achieve something bigger than you could achieve alone, if you want to “burst the bounds of your brain”, you have to care about the people you are working with. You’ll get more done if you take the time to incorporate their thinking into  yours, and yours into theirs.

  
  

Harvard business review article: a culture that captures thousands of “small’ innovations can create benefits for customers that are impossible for competitors to imitate. One big idea is pretty easy to copy, but thousands of tweaks are impossible to see from the outside, let alone imitate.

  
  

Poking holes in new ideas doesn’t necessarily kill them - it can push people to clarify their thinking.

  
  

You need to push \[your team\] to communicate with such precision and clarity that it’s impossible not to grasp their argument

  
  

Aristotle: “Emotion, credibility, logic”

  
  

Building trust in any relationship takes time because trust is built on a consistent pattern of acting in good faith.

  
  

The “golden rule” says do unto others as you’d have them do to you. The “platinum rule” says figure out what makes the other person comfortable, and do that.

  
  

You can’t “fix” yourself once and for all’ you have to manage yourself, daily.

  
  

When bias plays out over a whole organisation, the impact on female leadership is profound. Researchers ran a simulation of what happens to promotions over the course of several years when bias impacts ratings just a little bit. When gender bias accounts for just 5% of the difference in performance rating, an organisation that starts out with 58% of the entry level positions filled by women winds up with only 29% of the leadership positions filled by women
