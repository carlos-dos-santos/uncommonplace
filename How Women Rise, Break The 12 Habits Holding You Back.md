**As you will see, the trick to maximising your talents and opportunities is not becoming a less thoughtful and giving person, but rather being purposeful and intentional about your choices while also addressing the behaviours that keep you stuck. 

  

The transition from achiever to leader can be particularly hard for highly competitive men, who may have difficulty recognising that, as leader, their job is to make everyone else a winner. Women are less likely to struggle with this transition. 

  

Your responses help shape your circumstances. And your behaviours shape how others respond to you. That’s why being able to identify these behaviours is so important. 

  

\[on receiving feedback\] After all, even if a degree of bias is involved, you are still being given information. It is important to remember that our key stakeholders’ perceptions are real to them. Focusing only or even primarily on what’s wrong with whoever gives feedback is rarely the most effective route for reaching the next level of success. 

  

Many women \[...\] are deeply invested in being wonderful people. This is a great thing and helps make the world a better place. But this desire can work against you if it is allied with the belief that being wonderful means never disappointing others.

  

\[on being a role model for all/other women\] The idea that high-profile women do not get to make their own life choices first without considering the potential impact upon all other women is a pernicious trap. Being successful at a demanding job while trying to maintain a rewarding personal life is tough enough for anyone in today’s demanding work culture. Expecting women to also calculate personal decisions based on how others will interpret them adds an extra burden. It’s certainly not a burden men are expected to bear. 

  

It may sound paradoxical that this bias for action could make it hard for people to change, since change is usually associated with taking action. If you want to get fit, you head for the gym. If you want to rise in the organisation, you put in more hours. But a key insight as you progress in your career is that behavioural change is often about not acting rather than acting. As the business sage Peter Drucker famously noted, “We spend a lot of time teaching leaders what to do. We don’t spend nearly enough time teaching them what to stop.”

  

Organisations often fail to address women’s reluctance to effectively market themselves because they assume a male leadership template. 

  

Bear in mind that you are your primary product. As you talk about what you have achieved, you are always selling you - not just the details but the overall package. Every successful sales person knows this. People buy because they like and trust you. And because they believe what you offer may have value for them. Why do they believe this? Because you so obviously do! Mesmerising belief is the secret of every great salesperson. 

  

Dong Lao: “Having a clear, concise statement ready to deliver at any moment - one that says what you do now but emphasizes what you want to do in the future and why you’re qualified to do it - gives you a huge advantage in terms of visibility and positioning. It sets you apart from the pack and enables you to make the case for yourself at the highest level when the chance presents itself. In my experience, great careers are often built on chance encounters. So it always pays to be prepared.”

  

Expertise, connections, and personal authority are all non-positional kinds of power you can nurture and practice throughout your career. The more you develop these complementary powers, the more prepared you’ll be to assume positional power. 

  

Carlos Marin: “\[data\]... suggests that men at the executive level are most likely to be rewarded for daring and risk-taking \[...\] women at similar levels are most likely to be rewarded for precision and correctness. 

  

Carlos notes that people who set very high standards for themselves usually set very high standards for others. 

  

If \[ over-helping and/or doing everything yourself because you’re striving for perfection\] describes you, you might consider whether you are enabling those around you to be helpless, which is what people who fail to delegate often do. If this is your pattern at work and at home, you may end up expiring from the stress or becoming trapped in a resentful martyrdom. 

  

Like perfectionists, chronic pleasers often have trouble delegating. 

  

On the one hand, women are urged to “go for it” and aspire to leadership at the highest level. On the other, they’re warned about the consequences of missing virtually any activity involving their kids. The fact that balance is now more often described as “work-life integration” doesn’t change the basic message, which is that women not only can “have it all” but that they are fatally flawed if they do not. 

  

Workplace cultural standards around the world have been almost entirely set by men, especially at the leadership level. 

  

Susan Nolen-Hoeksema, who until her early death was the leading researcher on rumination, believed women were predisposed to it because of the high value they place on relationships. 

  

So if you have a tendency to self-judge, it’s worth repeating that there is no ideal standard for humans in this world. Each one of us is a work in progress and will be until we draw our final breath. 

  

Judgement of self or others won’t improve the quality of your life. It certainly won’t make you happier. But it will keep you stuck when you’re trying to shift behaviours so you can become that most wondrous of creatures, your best self. 

  

It’s important to bear in mind that every limiting behaviour is also rooted in a strength.
