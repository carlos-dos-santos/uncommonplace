"It's not an action, it's not a checklist, it's not things that you do so that you can prove to the world that you're a good person or that you're not racist," \[Layla\] Saad says firmly. "It is a way of life, it's a way of thinking about yourself in the world. It's a way of showing up every day, where this work is not separate, it's not like a project that you do on the side.

"And what I really want people to understand is that this is not a one-and-done thing, this is lifelong work. White supremacy is a system and it's impacted people of colour for forever. And so it's not going to be dismantled or overcome by people saying it as just a one-time thing or just a simple set of actions that they do, rather it's seeing themselves in the practice of anti-racism every day."

It is easy to watch the news and feel horror at mistreatment, violence and wide-reaching, fatal inequalities in the world. It’s harder to admit that we’re complicit. But there can be no doubt: now is the time to do so.
