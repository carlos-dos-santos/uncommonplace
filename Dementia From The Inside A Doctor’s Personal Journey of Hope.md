Living with others at boarding school one learns more lessons than those on the curriculum - one learns valuable life lessons.

Still, I am convinced that nothing is wasted in God’s economy. My dementia would turn out to be a glorious opportunity which would help people all over the world.

“Unafraid, I face with joy the morning of each day, 
Whatever looms ahead of me along the unknown way
My heart will sing God’s praises…”

Although the system is effective, at the heart of Japanese Memory Groups is laughter, along with relationships and warm, social interaction. We have fun, and enable joy. And each time I am reminded of the three main principles that are essential to understanding and helping people with dementia.

Spending time with people with dementia not only improves their ability to communicate but contributes to their sense of well-being.

Do we remember our version of events or someone else’s? Does it matter? How can we know, if others will not talk about it? In relationships, openness and truth are important, but in the end it is love and acceptance that count.

Many families will have strains and fractures long before dementia appears.

We need to affirm people when they do things that they might not want to do, not blame them. Feelings of guilt are corrosive and destructive.

The use of language about people with dementia also makes a great difference, and I’m sure that moderating the way we describe dementia has played a part in reducing stigma over the last ten years. Language is important, because it influences and defines perceptions. Many of the negative connotations attached to dementia relate to the words that are used, and the result, for many, is a lack of hope. Many conditions force us to negotiate dreadful paths, such as cancer, strokes, multiple sclerosis - all kinds of disabilities - but we don’t use the same language about them. So rather than referring to a ‘dementia sufferer’, which denotes the person as a victim, why not use the term ‘person with dementia’? There are times, of course, when we do suffer, and so do those around us, but that does not define who we are.

Robin Dunbar, Professor of Experimental Psychology at Oxford University, says \[...\] that it is our relationships that have the strongest impacts on survival, even with patients who have had heart attacks. Yet, ‘despite these findings, the importance of social networks has been ignored completely by the medical profession,’ he added.
